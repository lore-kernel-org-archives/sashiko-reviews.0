This should really have been flagged as a pre-existing issue vs a new
regression, it is not a behavior introduced (or changed) by your patch.

FWIW, it's not coming from QEMU -- we don't even have a CC=2 return case
for RPCIT today, and we never update the iova/range on return.

Perhaps, lacking access to the ISA documentation, it made an assumption
that the range would be updated to shorten the next RPCIT as this would
allow us to converge towards a smaller and smaller range each attempt to
potentially not hit the busy condition eventually - sounds logical anyway?

But I also find nothing that indicates the range will/should be updated
on CC=2 (or otherwise) from RPCIT; so it does just sound like a bad
assumption.

That matches your observation:  we indeed aren't taking updates to the
range in __rpcit().  But as you say: there aren't supposed to be any.

That concern sounds valid at face value; if we tried something and it
couldn't be completed in time, from a linux perspective we are simply
trying it again without changing anything and hoping everything works
for the best this time.

I think that is the rub.  Sashiko couldn't possibly know that such an
architecture guarantee exists.

I suspect the question is also a bit theoretical: what happens if the
range is so big that it's impossible for the RPCIT to process it before
the CC2 trigger point due simply to how big the range provided is?  Then
you're guaranteed to hit it every time unless you 'chip away' at it by
shrinking the range after each attempt.

I would assume/hope that the SDMA-EDMA range limitation we impose on the
aperture size already ensures that it is easily possible to handle a
RPCIT from SDMA thru EDMA without tripping CC=2.
So then the CC=2 case becomes purely situational vs a guaranteed result
even for the largest possible RPCIT request.  That already makes it far
more reasonable to simply try it again.

So: assuming that architecture guarantee stands (we know RPCIT can
possibly complete for the largest possible range SDMA-EDMA, and we have
some architected guarantee that the loop will be broken otherwise e.g.
architecture says it won't keep giving us CC2s forever) then it sounds
like nothing to fix, but maybe worth a comment in a future patch that
explains these guarantees, based on what you find in the ISA.

I suppose we can consider whether linux should have its own redundancy
here or not in addition to those guarantees.  That sounds well beyond
the scope of this series and goes back to what I mentioned at the start:
 this is pre-existing bevahior and should not hold up this patch either way.

Thanks,
Matt
