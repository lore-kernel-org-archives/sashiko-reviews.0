This is a sample module, which will be enabled after the system is fully
loaded. Total will not be 0 at that time.

As mentioned with SJ before, it is unlikely to have those systems using
THP. In case we find users with this issue, we can patch it.[1]

I will remove it.

As with the previous patch, we can make the module depend on TRANSPARENT_HUGEPAGE

Same as the previous issue.
