I don't think there is an unbalanced deinit here. The unconditional
rockchip_pcie_phy_deinit() at the top of
rockchip_pcie_rc_reset_root_port() pairs with the
rockchip_pcie_phy_init() done at probe time, while the deinit_phy label
pairs with the rockchip_pcie_phy_init() performed inside this same
function. Every path keeps the pairs balanced: on success the PHY ends
up initialized exactly as it was before the reset, and on the error
paths the function unwinds precisely the initialization it performed
in this invocation. The only way to skew the refcounts would be
reset_control_assert() failing on two consecutive reset attempts, and
after the first such failure the controller is already dead.

Ack, this is a real issue introduced by b376b3ff9cb0. Devices may keep
their INTx line asserted while the controller clocks and PHY are gated
during the root port reset, so the chained handler can run and read the
unclocked APB bus.

I will send a follow-up that masks the INTx IRQ before turning the
clocks off and re-enables it once the clocks are running again. On the
error paths the clocks stay gated, so the IRQ is deliberately left
masked there.

This ordering is not introduced by this series: the original
.reset_root_port() implementation (b376b3ff9cb0) also called
pp->ops->init() — which performs the same DBI accesses — before writing 
PCIE_CLIENT_MODE_RC, so the order is unchanged. Also, the DBI
aperture is just memory-mapped configuration space behind the APB/AXI
bus; it does not depend on the PCIE_CLIENT_xxx mode bits, which select
the  link/LTSSM behaviour rather than gating config space access.
