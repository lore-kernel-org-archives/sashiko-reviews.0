Agree. There RMI_BUSY indicates the Pdev is busy with an ongoing
communication which could take longer.

REC_ENTER only tries to lock the REC object. The only other code that
tries to lock is the PSCI completion processing to update the "rec"
state to runnable. Hence we don't expect a the REC_ENTER to be waiting
for the REC object lock and encounter an RMI_BUSY. Also, REC_ENTER
locks the object to get a refcount on the granule and the lock is
released. So even if the host issued REC_ENTER in parallel, the second
one will encounter RMI_ERROR_REC due to the bumped refcount.

That said, I am happy to return to the caller on RMI_REC_ENTER in the 
worst case and pretend there was an IRQ and that would allow the KVM
to re-enter the guest after servicing the interrupts. I have added the 
following changes to the patch where we introduce the REC_ENTER:

+/*
+ * rmi_smccc_invoke_once: Invoke the RMI call and return the results. 
Do not
+ * retry the command. Let the caller deal with RMI_BUSY or RMI_BLOCKED.
+ */
+static inline void rmi_smccc_invoke_once(struct arm_smccc_1_2_regs *regs)
+{
+       struct arm_smccc_1_2_regs args = *regs;
+
+       arm_smccc_1_2_invoke(&args, regs);
+}
+

...


+/**
+ * rmi_rec_enter() - Enter a REC
+ * @rec: PA of the target REC
+ * @run_ptr: PA of RecRun structure
+ *
+ * Starts (or continues) execution within a REC.
+ *
+ * Return: RMI return code
+ */
+static inline long rmi_rec_enter(unsigned long rec, unsigned long run_ptr)
+{
+       struct arm_smccc_1_2_regs regs = {
+               SMC_RMI_REC_ENTER, rec, run_ptr,
+       };
+
+       rmi_smccc_invoke_once(&regs);
+       return regs.a0;
+}

Ack, done.
