Actually while reworking a bit my series I realized keeping HXT and LXT
is only needed for legacy DT, so we can keep their registration limited
to these old cases, and just no longer care about providing valid HXT
and LXT lookups in newer cases. Bindings shall not change, so let's keep
them that way. It is just no longer valid with newer DTs to reference
the clock controller to query HXT nor LXT. The result is pretty clean,
developpers will very easily identify the legacy part (as opposed to the
current state) and we avoid the churn of removing stale clock IDs.
