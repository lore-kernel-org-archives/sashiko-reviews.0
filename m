Thanks for the explanation, makes sense.

Yes, this is a real finding, and I ran into a related issue while doing
some 32-bit testing in a chroot on sparc64 earlier, even without a byte
swap.

memory_read() gives libdw 8 bytes, libdw keeps the low 32 bits for an
ELFCLASS32 target, and on big-endian that is the word at addr + 4.=A0

The chain stops at the first frame restored from the stack (and on
sparc an 8-byte load from an address that is only 4-byte aligned
traps).

I had parked the fix for that when I decided to focus on sparc64 only,
as there were already quite a few bits and pieces I wasn't sure about,
and I wanted some feedback before adding more.

But since you bring this up, I now have a patch for memory_read() that
handles both the native case and the cross-endian one, with the un-swap
you describe, picking the half that holds addr.=A0

It's tested with 32-bit sparc programs, natively on sparc64 and cross-
endian on x86.=A0

I sent it as a separate patch, since it's a generic fix, and would
appreciate it if you have time for a look:
[PATCH] perf unwind-libdw: Fix reading the stack of a 32-bit task
https://lore.kernel.org/all/20260923193432.2489729-1-stian@itx.no/

I did several tests on this series + the separate patch. Test details
in the patch.

No pending changes to v3 so far, everything in the separate patch.

Thanks for the review!

Best regards
Stian
