Thank you for your review. Regarding this point, I think it's almost
impossible for that to happen. Here are the two possible failure cases
and why they do not lead to NULL dereference:

1. When DP init is skipped (serdes register reads 0):
    The hardware only supports 1 MSI vector, so hibmc_msi_init() only
    registers the vblank handler, not the DP handler. Therefore
    hibmc_dp_get_hpd_status() is never called and no NULL dereference
    can occur.

2. When DP init fails:
    dp->dp_dev is allocated via devm_kzalloc(), which is only freed by
    devres on driver unbind. If devm_kzalloc() fails, hibmc_dp_hw_init()
    returns -ENOMEM before DP interrupts are enabled. If devm_kzalloc()
    succeeds but a later init step fails, dp->dp_dev is already assigned
    (non-NULL), so no NULL dereference occurs.

Please let me know if you see any other potential race condition.

Debouncing is implemented on-chip. The driver reads the
post-debounced state machine output, not the raw HPD pin
signal, so a single instantaneous read is sufficient and no
software debouncing loop is needed.

A monitor connected before boot does trigger an edge interrupt — it is
latched by hardware. This patch includes a 100ms sleep with an explicit
comment: "To latch the HPD interrupt, ensuring that DP can support more
modes within the fbcon framework when connected alone."

The sequence is: `hw_init` (latch window) -> `late_register` during
`drm_dev_register()` (enable interrupts, before userspace access) ->
latched HPD event fires and updates `hpd_status` in hardirq context. By
the time userspace can query the connector, `hpd_status` is already
correct.

I understand the concern. However, there are two key points:

1. When the hardware is not ready (`dp->hpd_status != HIBMC_HPD_IN`,
    i.e. no monitor connected), the driver should return early and not
    proceed with hardware enablement.

2. The `atomic_enable` callback has a `void` return type — the driver
    cannot propagate any failure back to the DRM framework, so silent
    return is the only option.

You are right, this is a valid race condition.

To fix it, I will use the local `status` variable directly for the
consistency check in the threaded handler, instead of re-reading
`priv->dp.irq_status`.

Since `status` is captured as a snapshot before the check, concurrent
updates from the hardirq handler cannot interleave and cause a
mismatch. This eliminates the race without requiring additional
locking.

I will send the v3 patch shortly. Please let me know if you have any
other concerns.

Thanks,
Yongbang.
