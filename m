AI slop:

Even if xfer_cb() is fired, it won't cause any UAF as all the resources are
freed in the client driver remove() callback which gets called last.

Not strictly required. Client drivers won't free the context until their
remove() callbacks are called.

While it is true that flush_async() implementation will affect shared channels
also, there is no use in passing the channel argument to it. Because, there is
no way we can selectively flush DMA for a single MHI channel. If multiple MHI
channels are sharing the same DMA channels, and a single client is going away,
then there is not much to do. But this is not very common or may not happen at
all.
