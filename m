Super interesting.

I guess Alder Lake isn't one of the RPs affected by
quirk_relaxedordering_disable()?  I think 87e09cdec4da ("PCI: Disable
Relaxed Ordering for some Intel processors") added all the existing
uses of that quirk for Intel RPs, and the commit log only mentions
Broadwell and Haswell.

I wonder if the PCI core should disable RO and NoSnoop on Root Ports
across the board?

I think this would mainly affect MMIO accesses performed by drivers,
and I suspect drivers expect those writes to be performed in order,
e.g., if the driver writes DMA descriptors to the device followed by a
write to a doorbell, those should stay in order.  If the RP has RO
enabled, those writes may be reordered.
