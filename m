Sure, not same locks. But essentially any device or HW unit level
locks held while dealing with userptr or using copy_from_user() would
now become potential deadlocks automatically. No need to take any nested
locks, it's just that whichever shared lock is taken will immediately
become a potential deadlock for completely unrelated DRM client and
thus also different process.

For the eudebug scenario here it's not to do with userptr. The access is
now done in patch 13 with access_process_vm() and hopefully in future
with access_remote_vm().

This lock we actually can easily refactor out. It's just a lock to
easily allow generating a coherent snapshot of DRM client resources
and debug metadata.

I'm just raising to concern generically for any userspace memory
access path be it copy_from_user() or userptr. Any lock taken on the
outside of such handling will become poisoned for all other DRM clients.

Wouldn't that then directly mean that anything to do with page-faults
would immediately exclude everything related to dma-bufs?

Doesn't that then raise the question if indefinitely stalling page fault
responses or improperly handling page fault responses is actually reasonable
if we want to support most GPU HW? Which I kinda hope we do want to support.
