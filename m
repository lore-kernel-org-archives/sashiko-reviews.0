But that seemingly unconditional statement has hidden clauses[*]:

 : 
 : My wording in the comment is misleading. The clear is part of the #VMEXIT path
 : out of guest mode, where it is indeed unconditional. However, VMRUN can
 : terminate even before the guest mode is ever entered. With ESMTP, the hardware
 : can give out a garden variety of exits at the sync point. In this case we
 : get a VMEXIT that implies the VMRUN never actually ran any guest code then
 : EVENTINJ won't be cleared. Since the exit code isn't a reliable discriminator,
 : a non-zero EVENTINJ is the only way to tell.

Ignoring that IMO the APM needs to be updated to clarify exactly when EVENTINJ
is cleared and when it isn't, I don't see any point in not manually clearing the
field on SHUTDOWN.  Common sense would say that it's unnecessary as SHUTDOWN can
only occur if VMRUN gets into the guest, but the cost is completely neglible and
there is zero chance EVENTINJ *needs* to be retained, unlike say the PML index.

We can certainly add a comment saying it's paranoid, but I do think we should
manually clear EVENTINJ and friend, e.g.

	/*
	 * EVENTINJ is cleared on #VMEXIT, but only if VMRUN fully entered the
	 * guest.  Manually clear the fields even though it should be redundant,
	 * as there is no downside to doing so.
	 */
	control->event_inj = 0;
	control->event_inj_err = 0;
