No, because this code path is specific to things which firmware claims 
to be the Graviton5 CMN, and as such it hard-codes the known topology of 
the Graviton5 CMN. We have to assume we can trust what firmware tells us 
about the platform, or we wouldn't even be able to boot.

No, because there is no such thing. The maximum possible number of DTC 
domains is 4. Even when correctly generated, the ID field in the 
register is only 2 bits:

No, the DTC logical ID is read from the logical_id field in 
por_dt_node_info, and while the main HN-D DTC always has an ID of 0, 
additional HN-T sub-DTCs should normally inherit the logical ID of their 
parent XP.

That is true, but since neither of those XPs has a DTC in this 
configuration, it is also entirely irrelevant.

No, because that would then be inconsistent with how the driver works 
normally on non-Graviton5 systems, and as Aviv already confirmed, it 
doesn't change the outcome in this case anyway.

No, __free_event() invokes event->destroy(), and if perf_alloc_event() 
could fail without freeing the event then that would be a much greater 
memory leak anyway.
