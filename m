Yes. It is the responsibility of the user to sync its dirty data before
initiating a depop.

Yes. It is the reponsibility of the user to not issue IOs while depop in on-going.

Partitions on zoned block devices are *not* supported. There are no partitions,
only the entire bdev.

Yes it is safe. If the user still issues IOs while depop or restore is in
progress, IOs may/will fail and the zone write plugging code will handle that,
so will the final zone revalidation.

Yes it will potentially desynchronize the state, but the user can initiate a
revalidation to re-synchronize everything. If the poll loop was interrupted, a
problem happened anyway.
