Yeah and that is exactly what you *must* do for userptrs.

There is no really alternative to that because you can't grab the same lock outside a page fault you do inside an MMU notfier.

So all drivers who use userptrs basically implement the following sequence:

1. Take a copy of page table update sequence number.
2. Walk page tables, extract PFNs.
3. Prepare your DMA operations.
4. Grab the MMU notifier lock.
5. Compare your sequence number, if it doesn't match revert everything and try again.
6. Submit your DMA operation to the HW
7. Drop the MMU notifier lock.

What you describe above for eudebug sounds a lot like it won't work correctly, you can't work with outside locks in the userptr handling.

That won't work like that. Both FUSE and UFFD can take any time they want for an operation.

Correct, that copy_from_user() can take any amount of time is perfectly expected.

The problem is that most GPU HW currently can't deal with that because it can't take the work of the HW in case of a fault.
