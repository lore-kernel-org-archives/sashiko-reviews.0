Moving PM_RUNTIME_ACQUIRE() inside the while loop may lead to repeated
D0 -> D3hot -> D0 -> D3hot ... transitions (depending on autosuspend
settings of the device, which are user-configurable through sysfs).
It would also lead to overhead induced by runtime PM code (repeated
spinlock acquisition etc).

So I believe keeping PM_RUNTIME_ACQUIRE() outside the while loop is
the right thing to do, but I'll leave this to AMD engineers to decide.

If the device is deleted anyway, we don't care about leaked references.
And we absolutely do not want to synchronously runtime suspend here.

Hallucination, this code does not perform "generic DOE" exchanges, only
CMA-SPDM ones.

We have to leave de-enumerated devices in D0 to ensure that a subsequent
rescan successfully re-enumerates them.  E.g. leaving a Downstream Port
in D3hot upon de-enumeration would leave any children inaccessible.

We also leave unbound devices in D0 for similar reasons.
