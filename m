I'm describing the UAPI behavior of what we already have. Please do not
change anything and continue to leave userspace in charge of eager
splitting / chunk size.

If the VMM wants to do lazy splitting, yes. Otherwise this would happen
as part of eager page splitting for block mappings that are known to be
writable.

That's why I'm saying to use a software bit. We can't leave DBM=1 on
block mappings and set VTCR_EL2.HD=1 for obvious reasons.

We need to do dirty tracking at page granularity. The only scenario
where we have writable block mappings while dirty logging is enabled on
a memslot is if the VMM enabled KVM_DIRTY_LOG_INITIALLY_SET.
