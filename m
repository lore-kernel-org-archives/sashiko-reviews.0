Pretty sure we can avoid the additional state tracking so long as we
ensure the nested S2 permission checks are ordered before anything
happening 'downstream' of the MMU.

Pairing an R+W check in kvm_s2_handle_perm_fault() along with a change
to kvm_is_write_fault() to only consider HA=1 permission faults to be
writes should do the trick. I've got the following blurb locally:

I will admit, I have an extreme distaste for how subtle this is + the
reliance on implementation detail.

Given the present company on NV, I'm not entirely sure SW will actually sort
itself out :)

Thanks,
