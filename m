I think it's a mistake that we expose both pcie_reset_flr() and
pcie_flr() to drivers.  It's unnecessary complication and may lead to
pcie_flr() being used to work around device defects, e.g., the 82599
issue, without any explanation.

Ideally I think we should convert the dozen or so callers of
pcie_flr() to pcie_reset_flr().  Since they never called
pcie_has_flr(), they initiate an FLR without checking for FLR support,
so they *could* have the same defect as 82599, i.e., they don't
advertise PCI_EXP_DEVCAP_FLR but FLR does actually work.

So converting would be slightly risky but I think the number is small
enough to be manageable, though it would be out of scope for *this*
series, of course.

Yes.  That device looks defective in that FLR is mandatory for PFs and
VFs and PCI_EXP_DEVCAP_FLR must be set, but it is not set for 82599
VFs.

When c763e7b58f71 ("PCI: add Intel 82599 Virtual Function
specific reset method") added reset_intel_82599_sfp_virtfn(),
pcie_flr() read PCI_EXP_DEVCAP to check for PCI_EXP_DEVCAP_FLR every
time it was called.

PCI_EXP_DEVCAP is a read-only register that is now cached in
dev->devcap by set_pcie_port_type(), and pcie_reset_flr() checks the
cached value for PCI_EXP_DEVCAP_FLR.

So I think reset_intel_82599_sfp_virtfn() could be reworked to be an
early quirk that sets PCI_EXP_DEVCAP_FLR in dev->devcap, instead of
being a device-specific reset method.  Then pcie_reset_flr() should
just work.
