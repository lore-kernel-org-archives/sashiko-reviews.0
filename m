Hi,

pci_save_state() is called from the driver's probe path, which runs 
after enumeration has completed.  pcie_reduce_mps() runs during 
enumeration, i.e. before any driver can have called pci_save_state(). 
The saved state therefore already contains the reduced MPS and it is 
restored correctly on resume.

pcie_set_mps() does not perform an unlocked RMW.  It calls
pcie_capability_clear_and_set_word(), which serializes config space
access through pci_lock.  Concurrent access from userspace (VFIO) or 
from pcie_set_readrq() cannot corrupt PCI_EXP_DEVCTL.

The concern is valid in principle, but pci_configure_mps() is only
called from pci_configure_device() during pci_setup_device(), i.e. while
the device is being enumerated and before its driver has probed.  No
device below the Root Port can be actively driving TLPs at that point,
so the "active NIC or early firmware-driven display controller" scenario
does not apply on this path.

The same applies to the hotplug case: the newly added device goes 
throughpci_setup_device() and pci_configure_mps() before it is bound to 
a driver.  Reducing the Root Port's MPS when a downstream device has a
smaller MPSS is also pre-existing behaviour from 9f0e89359775; this
series extends it to Switch ports and already-programmed siblings, which
is required to fix the Switch mismatch reported in v8.  I will document
this precondition in the commit message.




Best regards,
Hans
