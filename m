Thanks for the review. Let me address the three points:

1. Silent drop on queue full:
The pr_warn() + return fallback was introduced in the original commit 
d466c19cead5
("RISC-V: KVM: Add common nested acceleration support"), but it was dead 
code
until now because try_count was never decremented. The primary purpose 
of this
patch is to fix the soft lockup; making the fallback reachable is the 
direct
consequence of fixing that bug.

A host kernel hang is strictly worse than a dropped hfence entry. 
Furthermore,
the entire hfence execution pipeline (__kvm_riscv_nacl_hfence and the
kvm_riscv_local_hfence_* family) returns void, meaning no error-propagation
path exists today. Rethinking the error-handling guarantee for HFENCE is a
broader API redesign that should be handled separately.

2. TOCTOU / Memory Ordering & 3. Preemptible this_cpu_ptr:
Both are pre-existing issues (as noted by the bot) and are neither 
introduced
nor modified by this single-line fix. They are valid concerns that deserve
their own standalone patches to keep this soft-lockup fix minimal and 
backport-friendly.

I will follow up with separate patches for the pre-existing issues if 
needed.
