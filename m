Maybe. Another solution would be to put it after anything that may present 
any error. I wonder how ofter do we get kvm to fail startup, though.

That's not a label.

I get the error code by reading a 2-bit bitfield. There can only be 4 
different combinations here, and all are dealt with.

I am pretty sure this is done by generic code.

This is a per-cpu irq, and above happens when we are enabling 
virtualization on a CPU. Prior to the endo of kvm_hacdbs_cpu_up() there 
should be no guest running in this cpu, so faulting is not an issue.

This is called in init time, by kvm_arm_init(). Also, it should not matter 
as we are not actually touching anything from that cpu, but instead just 
fetching this read-only information about the IRQ.

Adding a test here could be easy.
In any case I remember testing with the table entry being zero and this 
not being an issue.

This feature should only be enabled if the whole system supports HACDBS, so 
once one cpu succeeds in request_percpu_irq() every other one should 
succeed as well.

The availability is tracked by hacdbsirq variable. Once it's set, it means 
the whole system supports hacdbs, and the IRQ is available.

No, and __load_stage2 will do that anyway if needed, as it also sets 
registers. Also, it's done at the end of hacdbs_start()

it's done at the end of hacdbs_start.

Those intructions are unrelated between themselves, the one at the end of 
hacdbs_start() should be enough.

Until the next interrupt, though. Very unlikely, but possible.

Maybe a WFIT (timeout), then?

And that could mean possibly running though entries that are not supposed 
to be valid, but could be because we are talking about random data.
So we need to make sure the write buffer is clear before setting the 
register.
