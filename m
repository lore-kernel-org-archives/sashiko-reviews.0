Yes, I agree. This patch didn't touch/remove the capability to pass
back a modified addr or range.

I went back to commit cd24834130ac ("s390/pci: base support") from 2012
when RPCIT was introduced: The potentially endless loop on CC=3D2 was
introduced at the very beginning.

I found explicit words in the ISA specifying that "no other action is
taken" when the instruction ends with CC=3D2. IIRC, CC=3D2 was introduced
to signal a program that there are internal inhibitors present that
prohibit to even start the requested "refresh" - or other PCI
instructions. I still have to search for a statement that guarantees at
the architecture level that CC=3D2 won't be presented forever. When I
find that, I'll think about how to frame that into a future patch.
