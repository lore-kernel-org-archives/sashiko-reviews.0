I did it this way because (as you also stated) it's more robust, and it
also documents the ordering requirements:
- We need to service local flushes before switching to the new VMCB.
- We need to queue new flushes after servicing local flushes.

I like that it's all in one place. All that being said, I did go
back-and-forth on this so I am not opposed to open-coding it. Let me
know if the above argument swayed you or if you still prefer
open-coding.
