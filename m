You are right, this is a genuine race condition and needs to be fixed.

I understand the concern, but I believe clearing the flag in
`hibmc_hw_init()` is unnecessary and would actually be harmful. Here
are three independent reasons:

1. Flag purpose: HIBMC_ENABLE_STATE (BIT(2)) signals the BMC that the
    OS DP driver has finished initialization. Clearing it would cause
    the BMC to believe the OS is not loaded, triggering a host switch
    that disrupts the current host's display in dual-host KVM scenarios.

2. BMC judgment conditions: The BMC does not rely solely on this flag —
    it also checks host presence state. Even if the flag remains set,
    the BMC would not send DP interrupts to a host whose driver has not
    initialized. The risk scenario described in the review does not
    exist.

3. Register cleared on host reset: The register (0x802A4) is cleared by
    hardware on host reset. Since kexec triggers a host reset, the flag
    is already zeroed — the review's premise that "the flag persists
    from the previous boot" is invalid on the kexec path.

Additionally, `hibmc_dp_hw_init()` disables DP interrupts during init,
and they are only re-enabled after the IRQ handler is registered.

You are right, I will move `hibmc_set_enable_flag()` before `drm_dev_register()`
in v3.

I don't believe this change would cause a shutdown hang, for two
reasons:

1. HIBMC_ENABLE_FLAG does not control any hardware display pipeline —
    it is only a software communication flag between the OS driver and
    the BMC. Clearing it does not forcefully disable any hardware
    block.

2. drm_atomic_helper_shutdown() and all I2C/AUX operations work
    directly through MMIO registers, independent of this flag's state.
    Therefore, disabling the flag cannot cause I2C/AUX timeouts or
    hanging commits.

Additionally, moving the disable flag call after drm_dev_unregister()
provides proper symmetry with the probe path (where we set the enable
flag before drm_dev_register()).

Hi Thomas,

Sashiko AI raised a use-after-unmap concern on the poll worker in
hibmc_pci_remove. Investigation found the issue has two aspects, both
class-level (not hibmc-specific — ast and mgag200 share the same
structure).

The scoping question that determines severity and scope:

   Should "userspace holds a DRM fd during device unbind / hot-unplug"
   be a scenario bmc considers?

This determines which aspect matters and how far the fix should go.

   == Aspect 1: fd-held unbind (special trigger, ~certain UAF) ==

   Trigger: PCI unbind via sysfs while userspace holds a DRM fd.
   This is a special path (developer/abnormal operation), but once
   triggered the UAF is basically guaranteed. devres unwinds in reverse
   order: iounmap runs BEFORE drm_dev_put. With kref > 0, drm_dev_release
   never triggers, so all drmm actions are skipped and the poll worker
   keeps running after MMIO is unmapped:

     pci_remove  (same timing for hibmc / ast / mgag200)
     +-- drm_dev_unregister()       registered=false; unplugged NOT set
     +-- unload / atomic_helper_shutdown   [no explicit poll_fini]
     --- devres unwind (reverse order) ---
     #2  iounmap(mmio)              <-- MMIO DEAD FROM HERE
     #1  drm_dev_put()              kref > 0 (fd held)
         |
         X  drmm actions: NEVER run <-- poll_fini skipped (hibmc/ast)
         |                          <-- i2c_del_adapter skipped (ast/mga)
         |
         +-- poll worker: detect -> I2C -> readl/writel(mmio)  [UAF]
         |   (~10s, only if VGA connector polled; DP is POLL_HPD, skipped)
         +-- ioctl on open fd: detect -> AUX/I2C -> readl/writel(mmio)
         |   [UAF, IMMEDIATE — confirmed by oops]
         |   Xorg holds fd -> GETCONNECTOR -> hibmc_dp_aux_xfer
         |   -> readl(priv->mmio) -> page fault
         +-- DP HPD ISR (hibmc only): drm_dev_enter -> unplugged? NO -> [UAF]

   Manual poll_fini closes the poll worker path but NOT the ioctl path —
   ioctl doesn't go through the poll worker. Closing ioctl requires:
     (a1) drm_dev_unplug instead of drm_dev_unregister in pci_remove
          -> sets dev->unplugged, blocks ioctl in drm_ioctl,
          activates drm_dev_enter
     (a2) drm_dev_enter/drm_dev_exit in detect and I2C/AUX callbacks
     (a2) without (a1) is a no-op — this is why the existing DP HPD ISR
     protection is currently ineffective.

   So the scoping question becomes: if the fd-held scenario should be
   handled, (a1)+(a2) are needed beyond poll_fini.

   == Aspect 2: no-fd unbind (normal path, us-level window) ==

   Trigger: rmmod (blocked by fd, so no fd when it runs) or normal
   shutdown. This is the ordinary path.

   I checked drm_atomic_helper_shutdown (drm_atomic_helper.c):
   it only calls drm_atomic_helper_disable_all (disables all CRTC) and
   does NOT stop the poll worker. So the poll worker is only stopped by
   the drmm release action at kref=0, which runs AFTER iounmap:

     pci_remove
     +-- drm_dev_unregister()
     +-- hibmc_unload
     |   +-- drm_atomic_helper_shutdown()    [disables CRTC, NOT poll]
     --- devres unwind ---
     #2  iounmap(priv->mmio)            <-- MMIO DEAD (window starts)
     #1  drm_dev_put -> kref=0 -> drmm poll_fini   [STOP, window ends]
                                         ^^^ us-level gap ^^^

   The window is us-level (devres unwind between iounmap and drm_dev_put),
   poll period is 10s, so probability is ~10^-6. Combined with "BMC GPU
   rmmod is rare in production", this likely explains why it hasn't
   surfaced. But the window is structurally real.

   Manual poll_fini in hibmc_unload closes this window — stops the poll
   worker BEFORE iounmap. This is sufficient and curative for Aspect 2.
   ast and mgag200 have the same window and should apply the same fix.

     Proposed fix:

     hibmc_pci_remove
     +-- drm_dev_unregister()
     +-- hibmc_unload
     |   +-- drm_kms_helper_poll_fini()   <-- STOP POLL WORKER HERE
     |   +-- drm_atomic_helper_shutdown()
     --- devres unwind ---
     #2  iounmap(priv->mmio)              <-- worker already stopped, safe
     #1  drm_dev_put -> drmm poll_fini -> poll_enabled=false, early-return

   The drmm release action checks poll_enabled and early-returns when
   false, so the duplicate drmm call after a manual poll_fini is safe —
   no double cancel, no warning. Error paths are also safe (poll_enabled
   =false at init if drmm_kms_helper_poll_init hasn't run).

   == Summary ==

   poll_fini (Aspect 2 fix) should be done regardless — it closes a real
   (if small) window in the normal path, and applies to all three BMC
   GPU drivers. The scoping question is whether to also do (a1)+(a2)
   for the fd-held scenario (Aspect 1). If yes, poll_fini is still
   needed (drm_dev_unplug doesn't stop the poll worker); if no, poll_fini
   alone is the original review suggestion and sufficient for Aspect 2.

Thanks,
Yongbang.
