The issue is theoretical and does not arise with a single link TSM
driver. The PCI device's "connect" attribute is added only after
pci_tsm_register() succeeds.

The race can occur when registering a second TSM. The "connect"
attribute already exists, and userspace may try to connect using the new
link driver, for example "tsm1". connect_store() then looks up ID 1 and
can find the new tsm_dev in tsm_class because device_add() has already
completed.

The proposed fix is to reorder registration so that device_add() is
called last.

ie, changes the sequence from:

	rc = dev_set_name(dev, "tsm%d", tsm_dev->id);
	if (rc)
		return ERR_PTR(rc);

	rc = device_add(dev);
	if (rc)
		return ERR_PTR(rc);

	return tsm_register_pci_or_reset(no_free_ptr(tsm_dev), pci_ops);

to this.

	rc = dev_set_name(dev, "tsm%d", tsm_dev->id);
	if (rc)
		return ERR_PTR(rc);

	/* Complete PCI registration before exposing the TSM to class lookup. */
	rc = tsm_register_pci(tsm_dev, pci_ops);
	if (rc)
		return ERR_PTR(rc);

	rc = device_add(dev);
	if (rc) {
		if (pci_ops)
			pci_tsm_unregister(tsm_dev);
		return ERR_PTR(rc);
	}

	/* Notify TSM userspace that PCI/TSM operations are now possible. */
	if (pci_ops)
		kobject_uevent(&dev->kobj, KOBJ_CHANGE);

Agreed. It would be useful to understand the complete expected userspace
flow.

This could also be a manual setup in which the administrator explicitly
marks specific devices for IDE connection?

I expect these operations to require manual setup: the administrator
would first unbind the device from its driver, configure IDE, and then
bind it to vfio-pci if the device is to be passed through. Since device
bind and unbind operations are already driven through sysfs, it seems
natural for the connect operation to use sysfs as well?
