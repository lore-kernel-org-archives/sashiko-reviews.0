That's true. For the SPE case, it doesn't matter, because the failure reason is
dirty page logging being enabled for a memslot. For the unsupported CPU case it
might matter, but in that case it's called with preemption disabled so the cpu
ID is stable. I can call smp_processor_id() with preemption disabled, or have
the caller supply a cpu id and an argument.

I'll also update my testing configuration, to include CONFIG_DEBUG_PREEMPT. I
think at some point I disabled the debug options because it was making Linux too
slow and forgot to re-enable all of them.

This is called from kvm_arch_commit_memory_region() ->
kvm_spe_remove_dirty_logging() only if the memslot is backed by guest_memfd and
the memslot is not read-only. guest_memfd is a memory provider independent of
the host mapping, and guest_memfd backed memory is always mapped as writable at
stage 2.

Also worth point out the check that kvm_remove_dirty_logging() performs:

        if (!kvm_slot_has_gmem(slot) || (slot->flags & KVM_MEM_READONLY))
                return;

The read-only check is done for consistency with gmem_abort(), because KVM
rejects the KVM_MEM_READONLY | KVM_MEM_GUEST_MEMFD combination of flags for a
memslot.

Did I get the math wrong? Yes, I did.

Yes, it can. On the other hand, why would anyone enable dirty page logging for a
memslot if they are not planning to do migration, which requires all memslots to
have dirty page logging enabled?

I would rather know first if dirty page logging for SPE enabled VMs is actually
worth enabling before thinking of such edge cases.

Alex
