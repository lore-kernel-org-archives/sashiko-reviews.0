This is correct behavior, not a bug:

1. When CONFIG_HAVE_CLK is disabled, the entire clock framework is
    compiled out. devm_clk_get_enabled() returning NULL indicates
    "no clock management needed", and PTR_ERR_OR_ZERO(NULL) = 0
    correctly allows probe to proceed.

2. The Gemini SoC (the only user of this driver) always enables
    CONFIG_HAVE_CLK via ARCH_GEMINI in its defconfig.

3. This is the standard pattern used throughout the kernel for
    optional clock handling (see devm_clk_get_optional_enabled()
    documentation in include/linux/clk.h).

The old code's "optional" treatment was itself a bug, not a feature:

1. The hardware requires both PCLK and EXTCLK to function. Without
    PCLK, the RTC registers cannot be accessed. The old code would
    continue probe, map memory, and register the device, leading to
    synchronous external aborts on the first register read.

2. The devicetree binding (Documentation/devicetree/bindings/rtc/
    faraday,ftrtc010.yaml) lists both clocks as required properties.

3. Both compatible strings ("cortina,gemini-rtc" and
    "faraday,ftrtc010") reference devicetrees that always include
    both clocks. There are no known device trees that omit them.

4. Failing probe is strictly better than the old behavior: the
    error is reported clearly, and the driver can be retried or
    unloaded cleanly.

Same answer as above -- the behavior is correct and the old code
was buggy. Both clocks are required by the hardware and the
devicetree binding.

Please see the response to the same concern on patch 1. The RTC
hardware is never configured to generate interrupts, and IRQ 17 is
not shared with other devices on the Gemini SoC. This is outside
the scope of this patch.

Please see the response to the same concern on patch 1. The 1 Hz
tick rate makes this negligible in practice, and the hardware
provides no latching mechanism. This is outside the scope of this
patch.
