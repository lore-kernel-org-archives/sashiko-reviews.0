The default driver timeout is set to 60 seconds. I do not understand your p=
oint.
If the BIOS enables the hardware timeout and sets it to <n> minutes, withou=
t my
patch, the driver would still refresh the watchdog to <n> seconds (60 actua=
lly),
with "superio_outb(cr_wdt_timeout, wdog->timeout);". It forces second mode =
in
the control register anyway, and the driver has no way to know the previous=
ly
set timeout.
The only difference I see is that it does it immediately and does not rely =
on
the core to do it. It also do it only code.
Maybe I do not see something here.
