Well, we'd at minimum need supporting hardware since the feature must
also exist at stage-1.

AIUI the bug is that a change in mapping granularity (but not
necessarily OA) can cause a shadow stage-2 permission fault to remap at
a finer granularity and allocate table pages. This seems like something
we will eventually have to deal with for BBML3.

OTOH, I completely agree with you about changes to the OA. We should
synthesize a TLB conflict abort and let the L1 clean up the mess.

I was actually thinking about hardening the stage-2 map path, rejecting
valid->valid conversions that result in a change of the OA. We'll want
to have that anyway as Mostafa is adding support for BBML3, that error
could be propagated as a TLB conflict abort to the L1.

Thanks,
Oliver
