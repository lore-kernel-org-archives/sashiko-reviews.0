The observation is correct FWICT, but does not require a change to this
patch and probably also not in practice as no > 4K NVMes/controllers exist
AFAIK.

The sg_frame pool is created with an alignment of MR_DEFAULT_NVME_PAGE_SIZE:

	fusion->sg_dma_pool =
		dma_pool_create("mr_sg", &instance->pdev->dev,
				instance->max_chain_frame_sz,
				MR_DEFAULT_NVME_PAGE_SIZE, 0);

while the mask the loop tests against comes from

	mr_nvme_pg_size = max_t(u32, instance->nvme_page_size,
				MR_DEFAULT_NVME_PAGE_SIZE);

dma_pool backs its blocks with allocations of max(size, PAGE_SIZE), so the
CPU and DMA bases of a pool page are both PAGE_SIZE aligned and the blocks
sit at the same offset in each. The two tests agree as long as
mr_nvme_pg_size divides PAGE_SIZE, and can diverge once it is larger. The
driver then places the chain pointer where it sees a boundary and the
controller looks for one somewhere else, so it would read a data PRP as a
list pointer.

The misalignment can also introduce a chain pointer where an aligned buffer
has none: for a 4 KiB chain frame with an 8 KiB NVMe page size, a buffer at
0 modulo 8 KiB never trips the test, while one at 4 KiB modulo 8 KiB trips
it at offset 4088.

Reaching it needs instance->nvme_page_size above PAGE_SIZE, so above 4096 on
x86. The encoding allows it, 1 << (scratch_pad_3 & MR_NVME_PAGE_SIZE_MASK)
with a shift of at least 12, but NVMe puts the minimum memory page size at 4
KiB and the OCP datacenter SSD spec requires drives to report exactly that,
so I would not expect a larger value here. I have no data on what the MR
firmware actually reports, though. The driver logs the value at probe,

	dev_info(&instance->pdev->dev, "NVME page size\t: (%d)\n",
		 instance->nvme_page_size);

so a dmesg grep for "NVME page size" on any of the affected machines would
settle it. If one of them reports more than 4 KiB then this is live there,
and I would like to know.

This patch neither introduces nor widens that: it bounds how large a
transfer may be and does not touch where the chain pointers land.

The term that reserves room for the chain pointers,

	instance->max_chain_frame_sz / mr_nvme_pg_size

does share the assumption though: it counts boundaries as if the frame base
were page aligned, just as the test in megasas_make_prp_nvme() does, so with
a misaligned base it can be one short. I replayed the loop for chain frames
of 1024 to 15872 bytes, NVMe page sizes of 4, 8 and 16 KiB, every 4 KiB base
offset within a page, every 512 byte transfer start offset, and both
coalesced and one-entry-per-page scatterlists. The list never leaves the
frame, but above 4 KiB the worst case fills it exactly instead of leaving
the slot of slack it leaves today. At 4 KiB, where the pool alignment makes
the count exact, the margin stays.

So I would keep it out of this fix. The test wants ptr_sgl_phys instead;
that patch is below the scissors.

Subject: [PATCH] scsi: megaraid_sas: Test PRP boundaries on DMA address

megasas_make_prp_nvme() decides where the chain pointer that continues a
PRP list into the next page goes by testing the CPU address of the next
entry:

	page_mask_result = (uintptr_t)(ptr_sgl + 1) & page_mask;

The controller walks the same list by its DMA address. dma_pool backs its
blocks with allocations of max(size, PAGE_SIZE), so the CPU and DMA bases
of a pool page are both PAGE_SIZE aligned and the blocks sit at the same
offset in each. The two therefore agree modulo mr_nvme_pg_size only while
that divides PAGE_SIZE. Above it the driver can place the chain pointer
where the controller does not look for one, and the controller then
follows a data PRP as a list pointer.

The misalignment can add a boundary rather than move it: for a 4 KiB chain
frame with an 8 KiB NVMe page size a buffer at 0 modulo 8 KiB never trips
the test, while one at 4 KiB modulo 8 KiB trips it at offset 4088.

ptr_sgl_phys advances in lockstep with ptr_sgl, so test that instead.

NOTE: not really tested end-to-end as I do not have any controller
reporting an NVMe page size above 4096 here, not even sure one exists?
