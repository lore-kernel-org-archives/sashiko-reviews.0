I don't trust hardware/firmware. They can be buggy.=20

For instance, there's currently a bug at UEFI spec affecting RAS where
one particular field may have 3 different meanings because UEFI changed
its meaning on different versions of the spec without changing the version
field inside the CPER record:

	https://github.com/tianocore/edk2/issues/12708=09

If even firmware specs can't be trusted, I don't think it is safe to
assume that any particular implementation of the firmware or hardware
would be safe.

Thanks,
Mauro
