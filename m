Module code can only be called directly by module code, not built-in
code.  So CONFIG_CRYPTO_LIB_AES=m && CONFIG_BPF_CRYPTO=y cannot work;
you'd get a linker error.  For a module to offer these kfuncs they would
either need to be their own module (e.g. bpf_crypto.ko), or else merged
into the module of the underlying functions (libaes.ko, though again, in
practice libaes is usually built-in anyway for other reasons).
