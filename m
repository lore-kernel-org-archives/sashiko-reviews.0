Correct, and it is a regression I introduced between v1 and v2. The v2 cove=
r
letter also offered to spread the same mistake across six more drivers, so
that offer needs withdrawing before anything else.

Withdrawing the cleanup offer
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D

The cover said the "!" form is in gc05a2, gc08a3, imx283, lm3560, og0ve1b a=
nd
ov6211 and offered a cleanup converting them. Please do not take that up, a=
nd
if anyone has begun, stop: converting them to "<=3D 0" would break each of =
them
exactly as it broke this driver.

The reasoning behind the offer was wrong in a specific way worth naming. I
compared against i915, xe, ipa, ivpu and arm-smmu, which do test "> 0" or
"<=3D 0" - but they sit where CONFIG_PM is effectively mandatory, so the th=
ird
return never reaches them. drivers/media/i2c builds without PM, and that is
the whole of the difference.

The finding
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

Without CONFIG_PM the helper is, unconditionally:

  static inline int pm_runtime_get_if_active(struct device *dev)
  {
          return -EINVAL;
  }

v1's "if (!...)" fell through on that and applied the control, which is the
right thing to do: with no runtime PM the sensor is powered from probe and
never suspended. v2's "<=3D 0" returns 0 instead and drops it - exposure, g=
ain,
blanking, test pattern, all of them, with nothing reported to the caller.

v3 will use the shape ov64a40 already has:

          pm_status =3D pm_runtime_get_if_active(imx681->dev);
          if (!pm_status)
                  return 0;
          ...
          if (pm_status > 0)
                  pm_runtime_put(imx681->dev);

0 skips, 1 applies and puts, -EINVAL applies and does not put. That answers=
 the
first review's finding - the put of a reference never taken - without losin=
g
the case v1 had right by accident.

ov64a40 is the only fully correct caller of this helper in drivers/media/i2=
c.
I looked at it when the first review landed, wrote it down as a variant of =
the
same thing, and did not read its second half. Had I done so, v2 would have
carried this.

If a cleanup for the other six is still wanted, that is the shape it should
take, and I will send one only if a maintainer asks.

v3 follows this message. Respinning within hours is not something I would
normally do, but nobody has reviewed v2 yet and the alternative is asking
people to read code I already know is wrong. The change is ten lines, six o=
f
them comment, and 1/3 and 3/3 are byte-identical to v2.

The other finding, on 3/3, which is not ours
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D

The same run flagged a High issue in ipu-bridge and marked it pre-existing.=
 It
is - our 3/3 is two lines of table entry - but I checked it rather than wav=
ing
it past, and it looks real. Sakari, Dan: this is yours rather than mine.

The reference. sensor->adev =3D ACPI_PTR(acpi_dev_get(adev)) takes a second
reference to the ACPI device. On "goto err_free_swnodes" only the iterator'=
s is
dropped, by acpi_dev_put(adev), and bridge->n_sensors has not been incremen=
ted
yet, so ipu_bridge_unregister_sensors() does not walk this sensor either.
Narrow in practice: ipu_bridge_instantiate_ivsc() returns 0 immediately whe=
n
there is no csi_dev, so reaching it needs a machine with an IVSC.

The fwnode pointers look wider to me. primary->secondary is assigned in
ipu_bridge_connect_sensor(), and set_secondary_fwnode(sensor->csi_dev, fwno=
de)
in ipu_bridge_instantiate_ivsc(). Neither is cleared anywhere in the file,
while ipu_bridge_unregister_sensors() calls
software_node_unregister_node_group() on the nodes they point at. The file
walks that chain itself, in ipu_bridge_check_fwnode_graph(fwnode->secondary=
).
That is the ordinary unbind path rather than an error path.

No patch from me for either: I have no IVSC machine and no way to force the
failure, and an untested lifetime change in someone else's driver is worth
less than a clear report.
