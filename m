Specifically, `Owned::from_raw(ptr)` takes ownership without requiring the caller to promise the memory is or can be pinned; `Owned::into_raw(me)` safely extracts the pointer without documenting that the returned pointer's referent is still pinned; and `Ownable::release(this)` doesn't forbid the implementer from moving the pinned `Self` before dropping it. This omission allows an `Ownable` implementer or a user correctly following the explicit safety contracts to accidentally move a pinned `!Unpin` type, resulting in undefined behavior.

No. `this` is a pointer, and the value cannot be accessed or moved with
safe code. Moving out of `this` requires an unsafe block with proper
safety comments.

No. The documentation clearly state that this function takes ownership
of the underlying object. The caller no longer has authority to access
the object.

No. the return value is a pointer, and the pointee cannot be accessed or
moved with safe code. Moving out of `this` requires an unsafe block with
proper safety comments.
