Yeah, that's a good point, this is a leftover from the previous iteration where
SPE support in KVM was dependant on FEAT_FGT, which would trap accesses to those
registers if FEAT_SPE_FnE and/or FEAT_SPE_FDS were not exposed to the VM.

If FEAT_FGT is implemented, nothing changes. But if that's not present, I see
two way to handle it:

1. Save/restore the registers on each VM entry/exit and let the guest access
them as it wishes. This would go against the architecture, which says that
accesses are undefined if the corresponding feature is not implemented. In
practice, this might not be a problem if all hardware that implements
FEAT_SPE_FnE and FEAT_SPE_FDS also implements FEAT_FGT.

2. Trap *all* buffer control registers with MDCR_EL2.TPMS and inject an undefined
instruction exception.

Thoughts?

I haven't found any evidence to the contrary.

I haven't found anything in the Arm ARM saying that, and I don't see why writing
to PMBSR_EL1 would be a problem at all after the correct sequence for disabling
the buffer has been followed in __kvm_spe_save_host_state_vhe().

This is also how the SPE driver programs the buffer in the interrupt handler, if
there is indeed an issue the SPE driver would also have to be fixed.

Thanks,
Alex
