Yes, Zhaoxin system have fixed performance counters and a corresponding 
global control register.

This issue has indeed resulted in an “perf -e instructions” bug on 
Zhaoxin processors. Although Tanze submitted a patch in 2025, it seems 
it has not yet been merged to mainstream.

This issue may exist. Can the code be changed as follows?

if (edx.split.num_counters_fixed == 0) {
     x86_pmu.fixed_cntr_mask64 = 0;
} else {
     x86_pmu.fixed_cntr_mask64 = 
GENMASK_ULL(edx.split.num_counters_fixed - 1, 0);
}


In addition, this issue also appears to exist in the Intel PMU driver, 
should we fix them together?

Sincerely!
