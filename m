Oh, I should have called it out it's intentional to check the full 32 
bits Exit Reason instead of checking the lower 16 bits .basic field as 
what it did in the v2.

The purpose here is to return zero value for info1/info2/intr_info when 
there is no real Exit Reason, i.e., no real VM-Enter has happened. "Full 
32 bits Exit Reason equals TDX_INVALID_EXIT_REASON" indicates the case 
of no real Exit Reason.

There is one exception though: when real EPT_MISCONFIG happens without 
bus_lock_detected being 1. In this case, it's a false positive and KVM 
should go to the else path to read the info1/info2/intr_info. As noted 
in patch 2 under "---", this is an pre-existing issue and it will be 
address in a future series.

For the case that Sashiko cares, the only possible one is that real 
EPT_MISCONFIG happens when bus_lock_detected. In this case, passing the 
check of (*reason != TDX_INVALID_EXIT_REASON) to read the value of 
info1/info2/intr_info happens to be what we expect. (However, the exit 
reason is 0xFFFF instead of EPT_MISCONFIG). Anyway, it won't expose 
meaningless hardware state.

So, considering that the false-positive on EPT_MISCONFIG cannot be fully 
addressed with either checking the full 32 bits or checking the 16 bits 
basic field, and checking the full 32 bits can ensure identifying the no 
real Exit Reason cases. I just leave it as-is instead of changing it to 
check the basic field.

If it happens, it bypasses the KVM_BUG_ON(). But it will finally exit to 
userspace due to invalid Exit Reason, 0xFFFF.

Indeed, it may cause behavior change. But considering the EPT_MISCONFIG 
is not supposed to happen with current KVM's code, and we want to 
backport the series to stable kernels. We don't want to handle the 
theoretical issue that cannot happen in practice with this series, to 
make the series simple. We can harden the EPT_MISCONFIG code with 
another series separately.
