The documentation states it runs from there *and* once upon initial 
registration. This is the initial registration.

Probably they just shouldn't sleep, since the vast majority of cases are 
basically only to invoke irq_set_affinity() anyway. Hence it didn't seem 
worth overcomplicating the initial design, but if something does turn 
out to really need a thread, it could be done.

The expectation is that drivers should be able to clean up without 
requiring explicit teardown calls. This cpu_init call is really just to 
allow picking _some_ initial affinity at the right point in the process 
to avoid the races, without having to have some additional dedicated 
method just for that.

Oops, just a copy-paste error.

The idea of a driver which sets PERF_PMU_SCOPE_CPUMASK but does not 
provide init_cpu/exit_cpu was kind of in case of CPU-coupled devices 
which want to provide per-CPU events for some fixed subset of CPUs. I'm 
not sure any such thing exists, but it seems like more work to actively 
forbid it than to leave the possibility open...

Oops, could have sworn I fixed that... For these loops I initially had 
"< PERF_PMU_SCOPE_CPUMASK", decided that "<= PERF_PMU_SCOPE_SYS_WIDE" 
might be clearer, apparently somehow this one got stuck in-between.

Ooh, now that is a real bug. Indeed this isn't the same as the exit_cpu 
path, it needs to be in fully inverse order such that we sample the 
cpumask *before* init_cpu might update it.

> [Severity: High]
> What happens if the PMU cpumask is empty here?

Then the driver has done something egregiously wrong. However I guess 
since I do already have the WARN condition (for a misbehaving 
hotplug-only driver invalidly requesting migration), I may as well add 
cpumask_empty() to that as well.
