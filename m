Sure, changing this to something like PMD_SIZE or PUD_SIZE should be no issue.
 
But this raises a topic I would like to understand:
- Do we actually need this to be a block_size to assure correctness? or is 
  it just about efficiency?

I was thinking on using PUD_SIZE here before, but that would mean very 
different splitting granularity, as on 4k pagesize we would be splitting 
512*512 pages (above mentioned 256k pages), but on 16k pagesize we would be 
splitting 2048*2048 pages (4M), and on 64k pagesize it would be 8k*8k pages 
(64M). 

Doing that could defeat the purpose of chunk size to have a possible sleep 
to not keep the lock hold for too long. In that case, would not it make 
more sense to use a fixed number of pages instead?

But if it's already write-protected in S2, if the nested VCPU faults 
something, would not that be handled by non-nested faulting routine?

I understand very little of nested, and I can't understand how does that 
work properly. Maybe Marc or Wei Lin may have a better answer for that.
