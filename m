I was hoping it was fine just to grab _dso__data_open_lock but it seems
it should take dso__lock anyway.  I'll update the code.

As I said in the comment, I don't expect for user binaries and kernel
modules to set the binary_type before this function - I'll remove one
in the dso__load() later in this series as it may not be correct.

I'm not sure if we have a use case to access contents of data-only DSOs.
If so, I can add a check for ".data" section later.

This is another concern.  IMHO we handle guest samples poorly and
there's no good way to access to the guest DSOs.  Only perf kvm command
has options to access to the guest mount directory where it assumes
sshfs is available under a pid for the VMM that controls the guest.

This code is not touched for a while, and I doubt if there are any
users.  We need a better way to track guest info.

Until then, I don't want to make the APIs complex unnecessarily and just
use the hard-coded empty root directory for now.

Ack, will grab the dso lock.

As I said in another reply, I think it's ok to ignore data-only DSOs.

For NO_LIBELF=1 case, it didn't implement symbol loading.  So I don't
think it'd need binary data access for a DSO.  Since the primary use
case is perf annotate which works for symbols, I think it's ok not to
implement filename__has_section() in util/symbol-minimal.c

But it'd be not so hard to do it anyway.  We can add it later if it's
really needed.

Good point.  Maybe it need to save the errno and restore it before
return from filename__has_section().  Then the caller can check the
errno and retry as it can be called from dso__data_get_fd().

Yep, but __dso__find_binary_type() would run only once.
