Hi Frank,

Thanks for looking at this, and thanks to the bot for a careful pass.

Five of the eight are fixed for v8. Three do not apply to this driver
and I have tried to say why rather than just assert it.

> - [High] dmaengine: atcdmac300: UAF on driver unbind due to devres
> lifecycle mismatch
Fixed.

> - [High] dmaengine: atcdmac300: permanent controller halt if suspend

Fixed.

Fixed.

I do not think this one can happen. The data sheet defines the terminal
count bit of the interrupt status register at offset 0x30 as

	The terminal count status is set when a channel transfer
	finishes without the abort or error event.

so for one transfer the two are mutually exclusive. Chained transfers do
not widen the window either: the same document says that with IntTCMask=0
an interrupt is "only be generated when data transfer of the last linked
descriptor is complete", so a chain raises one terminal count rather than
one per link.

> - [Medium] dmaengine: atcdmac300: memory leak of unsubmitted
> descriptors
The desc_free half of this does not apply. The callback is reachable
only through dmaengine_desc_free(),

	static inline int dmaengine_desc_free(struct dma_async_tx_descriptor *desc)
	{
		/* this is supported for reusable desc, so check that */
		if (!dmaengine_desc_test_reuse(desc))
			return -EPERM;

		return desc->desc_free(desc);
	}:w

and a client can only set DMA_CTRL_REUSE through dmaengine_desc_set_reuse(),
which fails unless the channel advertises descriptor_reuse. This driver
does not set dma_device.descriptor_reuse, so the callback can never be
invoked and adding it would be dead code. Documentation/driver-api/
dmaengine/provider.rst puts it the same way: dmaengine_desc_free() "can
succeed only when DMA_CTRL_REUSE is already set".

I looked at closing that properly and do not think the API allows it.
There is no unprepare, so a client that abandons a descriptor makes no
call the driver could hook. Tracking every descriptor handed out would
move the recovery point from teardown to terminate or free_chan_resources
but not remove it, at the cost of a list operation on prep and submit.
Implementing DMA_CTRL_REUSE does not help either: dmaengine_desc_free()
requires the client to have set that flag first, and a client that intends
to abandon a descriptor is not one that asked to reuse it.

No in-tree client of this driver prepares a transfer it does not submit,
so I have left it. Say if you would rather have the tracking anyway.

Fixed.

Fixed.

> - [Low] dmaengine: atcdmac300: missing endianness conversions for DMA

This one cannot bite. The driver depends on ARCH_ANDES and Linux has no
big-endian RISC-V: arch/riscv/Kconfig offers neither CPU_BIG_ENDIAN nor
CPU_LITTLE_ENDIAN, so the conversions would be no-ops wherever this can
be built.

If here are no further comments, I will submit v8 with the five fixes.

Thanks,
CL Wang
