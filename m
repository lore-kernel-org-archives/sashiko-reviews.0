Hi Mr. Bot,

It was already argued into v1, no change. See v1's answer to your analysis.

You have a point, I'll send a v3

I'll propose something for the v3.

Yes !, v3

OK, I did revisit it. Because the chip is for .pages = 1, the core never re-writes
PMBUS_PAGE, so a raw write of a non-zero page via this debugfs hook would
fail with the hardware on that page and the core would keep reading it as page 0
until a reload

So v3 will remove probe_page_write entirely (same rationale as dropping the
now-useless PMBUS_PAGE swallow in write_byte).

yep, ok.
The v3 will wrap the whole sequence with pmbus_lock()/pmbus_unlock(),
nested outside the existing mps_lock.

right, the raw debugfs_create_u32() export cannot re-arm the worker.
I'll check it.

> [Severity: Medium]

Confirmed. The next v3 will wraps the worker's STATUS_WORD read within
pmbus_lock()/pmbus_unlock(), so it shall no longer race the
core's sysfs telemetry accesses.
