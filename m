Yes, it should not.
Was a misunderstanding of my part. Did not know that adding a resource in d=
river
registration would cause resource contention if other drivers try to access=
 the
SIO extended function mode.

My bad if it was not clear.
This series is an attempt of modernizing this driver to a platform driver s=
o
that it can use modern kernel APIs, expose sysfs interface, and clean the
driver.

And also add minute mode counting that is a feature that is just missing fr=
om
the driver. Maybe it should be a subject for another patch, outside of this
series ?

Sashiko reviews will be taken into account for the next iteration.
