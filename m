I'm not really sure this is correct. From:

    https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/driver-api/dmaengine/client.html

"Some DMA engine drivers may hold a spinlock between a successful preparation
and submission so it is important that these two operations are closely
paired."

What you presented above looks like abuse of the DMA engine API in light of
this statement. I also haven't found any place in the kernel where this would
happen.

What the docs say is legal is preparing/submitting a new transaction from
a completion callback but in this case the lock/unlock descriptors will be
refilled by the call to prep_slave_sg().

I would go with pre-allocated descriptors references from bam_chan,
re-allocated (if needed) on each prep_slave_sg() and just WARN() or even BUG()
if we ever end up not having any descriptors ready.
