I like it even less than demuxing vp_enter_ret on demand.  It has all the same
flaws as demuxing vp_enter_ret, because it's effectively just a cache of the
result of demuxing vp_enter_ret.  And caching values on entry/exit boundaries
adds additional risk;  I can point you at a number of bugs in the past where KVM
consumed stale data, e.g. because some chunk of code got moved to run before a
cached field was refreshed.  That's unlikekly to be a problem here, but anytime
data is cached it introduces risk of consuming stale data.

And the cost of demuxing vp_enter_ret every time doesn't concern me, at all.
What I don't like is relying on call sites to know that the exit_reason needs to
be demuxed in the first place, because that will be brittle and error prone.
That's why I'd be ok if vcpu_vt.exit_reason simply didn't exist: it becomes
impossible to check the wrong exit field because there's only one such field.

I'm ok caching the fully processed vcpu_vt.exit_reason, i.e. with the code now,
because only the TDVMCALL path needs to be aware that it may have undergone
processing, *and* KVM can WARN if that processing didn't happen as expected.

Whereas checking the "right" exit reason requires doing so in multiple paths and
doesn't have a natural sanity check.
