Somehow, this patch seems to be working, but yet, in view of this comment, I do
not see how the host busy counter is decremented for the deferred QCs. Something
is missing. We somehow need to call scsi_complete() with a status that leads to
the command disposition to fall to the default scsi_eh_scmd_add() so that we do
not immediately retry the command, since that also does not work (previous
version issue).

Spending the weekend on this was a waste of time. Back to the drawing board on this.
