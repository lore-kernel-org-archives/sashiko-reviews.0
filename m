Hi Matt,

Sashiko flagged a possible bitfield word-sharing race in v6:
remote_key_valid is read in mptcp_diag_fill_info() under
mptcp_data_lock(msk), but it shares a storage word with map_valid,
which is written in subflow_check_data_avail() and
subflow_data_ready() under the subflow socket's own lock in softirq
context. Different socks, different locks, so a concurrent read and
read-modify-write on that u32 looks possible.

As far as I can tell this is pre-existing rather than something this
patch introduces - remote_key_valid was already read and written from
those paths before, and the patch only adds one more reader. Is this
a known/accepted characteristic here, or does it need addressing? And
if it does, should that be part of this patch or a separate one?

Cheers,
Kalpan Jani

Subject: [PATCH net-next v6] mptcp: normalize seq numbers reported in mptcp_info

 > mptcpi_write_seq, mptcpi_snd_una and mptcpi_rcv_nxt report the raw
 > 64-bit data sequence numbers, seeded from the connection's IDSN/IASN.
 > Since the IDSN/IASN come from mptcp_crypto_key_sha(), these fields

 > calls and subtract to get anything meaningful, which is exactly what
 > tools/testing/selftests/net/mptcp/mptcp_sockopt.c already does.
 > 
 > mptcp_info also reports mptcpi_bytes_sent, mptcpi_bytes_received and

 > count starting at 0. The snapshot-and-diff workaround for the seq
 > fields is redundant once those are available.

 > Normalize mptcpi_write_seq, mptcpi_snd_una and mptcpi_rcv_nxt in

 > changed between the two normalizations. The subflow context is
 > otherwise released via kfree_rcu() once msk->first is cleared and the

 >   by Sashiko).

 > Changes since v3:

 >   remote_key_valid as a readiness flag while iasn could still be
 >   stale/uninitialized was a data race (reported by Sashiko).
