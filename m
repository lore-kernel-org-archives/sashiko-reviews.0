Do you mean that with my diff, the consumers of tdx_is_tdvmcall() rely 
on handle_tdcall() being called already?

If so, I get your point.

I'm OK with it.

After changing to use tdx_is_exit_reason_valid() instead of checking 
(*reason != -1u) in tdx_get_exit_info(), the only issue is 
trace_kvm_exit() prints 0x0000ffff when real EPT MISCONFIG happens. But 
it can be resolved by your suggestion below. So current implementation 
can still work.

btw, below change will also be in another separate series.
