The QMSI protocol defines specific access sizes: 4-byte for
magic/addresses, 2-byte for data. Guest drivers (ath11k/ath12k) use
exactly these sizes. Non-conforming reads would be a broken caller.

While not exploitable in practice (VFIO fds are held by QEMU, and
msi_first_desc() handles the no-MSI case), the double-fetch pattern is
bad practice. Fixed in v2: pre-fetch SET_IRQS header with
copy_from_user() before calling vfio_pci_core_ioctl(), using the
pre-fetched values for the MSI trigger decision.

Valid bug. Fixed in v2: added qcom_vfio_pci_close_device() wrapper that
resets msi_cached and all cached values (addr_lo, addr_hi, data) before
calling vfio_pci_core_close_device(). This ensures fresh MSI values are
captured on each VM attachment.

Addressed by the same close_device wrapper described above.

Same fix — close_device wrapper resets msi_cached on VM shutdown.

The write path (ioctl handler) and read path (config space read) are
both called from QEMU's per-device serialized VFIO operations. No
concurrent access occurs in practice.

On these specific Qualcomm devices, writes to unused extended config
space are safe and have been tested extensively. The writes provide a
backup persistent store, though the primary read path uses the in-memory
intercept. Will consider removing them if reviewers prefer a pure
software cache approach.

Same as the first finding — the protocol uses standard PCI config
access sizes. Sub-dword reads do not occur in practice.

Same as the write barrier finding — QEMU serializes these operations,
no concurrent access.

Valid for correctness, though all target platforms (x86, ARM64 for
Qualcomm WiFi passthrough) are little-endian. Will consider adding
cpu_to_le conversion if reviewers want cross-architecture correctness.

Same as above — not applicable on the target little-endian platforms.

Will send v2 with fixes for findings.
