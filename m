I agree, it could be possible some hosts could send the command as VERY_LON=
G report for newer devices which support that. I will change this to suppor=
t VERY_LONG reports also.

As per the "Protocol HID++2.0 essential features" section in https://lekens=
teyn.nl/files/logitech/logitech_hidpp_2.0_specification_draft_2012-06-04.pd=
f:
"
All functions must respect the following rule:
  All parameters in a request must always be repeated in the response:
    Any parameter that is fully supported must be repeated "as is".
    Any parameter that is only "partially supported", must be returned as s=
upported.

The following examples should help to better understand these requirement:
  A read command where an address (i.e., memory address, register address, =
etc.) is given as parameter must return the address and the data in the res=
ponse (and not just the address).
  A write command which sets a collection of bits or bit fields, should ret=
urn the same value where all unsupported bits and bit fields have been mask=
ed to their default values (usually 0).
  A command such as open-lock, erase-memory, etc. should return its paramet=
ers unchanged.

Note that there is no requirement to implement partial support. Each featur=
e designer is free to decide if "partially correct" parameters
should return and error or be "partially supported." However, if partial su=
pport is implemented, then the parameters must be returned
as supported.
"

Based on the aforementioned specification, all parameters must be echoed in=
 the response. If the SetWheelMode would not support setting hires paramete=
r (partial support), then hires parameter would be returned as default valu=
e 0 (low res) in the response. In that case, it is correct to set the multi=
plier to 1, since setting hires was not supported.

Unless there are verified cases of HID++ capable mouses behaving as describ=
ed in the review comment, or knowledge of newer version of the specificatio=
n to have changed aforementioned rule, I would assume all devices to work a=
ccording to the specification.

I agree that in theory there is a possible race condition. However, wheel_m=
ultiplier was already written to from hi_res_scroll_enable, and read from t=
he HID event handler before this patch. Not sure if this patch should addre=
ss this issue or not.
