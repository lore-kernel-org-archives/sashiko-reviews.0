I agree that this is an issue with the commit as posted here. I've 
re-worked this to keep the lock held while disabling direct injection. 
This prevents a concurrent unbind from freeing or reusing the host IRQ 
until we're done with the disable operation. At the point where the lock 
is release, we no longer use the host IRQ.

Uh, yes. I certainly hope so! kzalloc_obj is defined in 
include/linux/slab.h, which this file includes, and this allocation 
predates this commit. I'm not fixing this non-issue.

With the series as posted, this is an issue. Now that I've reworked it 
to use an XArray to track the translations it is no longer an issue. The 
lookup is now using RCU for the XArray.

This is the same issue as reported above. The translation_cache_lock has 
now been removed, and we're not taking any lock on the XArray itself. 
Therefore, this is no longer an issue with the upcoming repost.

Yes, of course this is passing the typed INTID directly to GIC VDPEND! 
We need to tell the GIC which type of interrupt we are injecting, so 
that's absolutely by design. We could arguably split this into type and 
ID, but what's the point? All we'd do is reconstrut that again on the 
other side.

Leaving this as is.

Yeah, agreed that the posted code is confusing and does mix those two 
styles. I've dropped the gotos and have replaced them with explcit 
reference drops and returns, instead. The scoped_guard()s remain.

These now happen under irq_lock, and therefore concurrent updates are no 
longer possible. We hold the lock when setting up and tearing down the 
forwarding, so these should not be able to unexpectedly change 
underneath us.

I've done the same as I said above - the gotos are now gone and have 
been replaced with explicit returns instead. scoped_guard() is still 
used to handle the locking.
