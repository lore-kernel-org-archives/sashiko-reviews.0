Thanks for providing the patch. The firmware is signed by AMD and driver 
can trust the register reading and management channel responses.

Adding more and more checks to verify the trusted firmware responses 
does not seem to be helpful. Instead, I would suggest to add comment for 
this which helps sashiko to better understand the design.

There are few legacy checks for rb_size which was used for firmware 
debugging and those should be removed.

> rb_start_addr=0x100000 against a measured ringbuf_size=0x80000, where the span
> clause cannot fire at all because ringbuf_size - rb_start_addr underflows in
> size_t to 0xFFFFFFFFFFF80000. That is the arm which shows the two clauses are
> not redundant. Two limits on it, stated rather than left to be inferred: the
> kernel short-circuits at the placement clause and so never evaluates the span
> clause on that input, which means the span clause's falsity there is
> arithmetic over hardware-measured operands rather than an observed branch, and
> I did not build a variant with the clause removed to show acceptance directly;
> and that arm has had one hardware run, not two, so I am not describing it as
> reproduced. The two x2i clauses were never injected at all and remain
> unexercised, for the reason given above.

> Finally, the injected values stand in for firmware rather than coming from
