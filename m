For READ, the code assigns the 16-bit swapped result of `cpu_to_le16(ep93xx_pata_read_data(...))` to `*pad`, which is an 8-bit `unsigned char`. This truncates the 16-bit value. On big-endian systems, `cpu_to_le16()` swaps the bytes, so this truncation discards the lower byte (the correct data from the bus) and saves the upper byte to the buffer. For WRITE, `le16_to_cpu(*pad)` promotes the 8-bit byte to an integer before swapping it, resulting in a shifted 16-bit value, which causes the device to receive corrupted data on the wrong data lines.
> - [High] The inline assembly delay loop `ep93xx_pata_delay()` lacks a `"memory"` clobber, permitting the compiler to reorder it with respect to I/O accesses, which violates ATA PIO timing requirements. On older ARM architectures like ARMv4T (used in EP93xx) where `CONFIG_ARM_DMA_MEM_BUFFERABLE` is not selected, the standard I/O macros (`__iormb()` and `__iowmb()`) evaluate to empty, meaning `writel()` and `readl()` provide no compiler memory barriers at all. Because `__raw_readl()` and `__raw_writel()` are implemented using `asm volatile` without `"memory"` clobbers, GCC's instruction scheduler is completely free to reorder these volatile I/O accesses across the `ep93xx_pata_delay()` loop. Even if memory barriers were present after the read or before the write, the `asm volatile` instructions themselves lack dependencies and can be swapped.

Rosen,

Can you look into this please and fix it in this same patch ?
The other critical problem can be fixed in a different patch.
