There is at least not a reference counting issue here, as GMEM still holds a
reference to the page.

Not sure about that, I havn't checked whether GMEM allows these kinds of
page-state changes before LAUNCH_FINISH. After LAUNCH_FINISH it is not problem
anymore because VMSA address in the VMCB does not point to a valid VMSA page,
then VMRUN will fail.

Wrong, VMSA pages are freed when they are KVM owned, when they are guest owned
they are freed via gmem. This is all fine if it happens after LAUNCH_FINISH and
no VCPU of the VM is still running.

Not sure if this is an issue. If it is then it is pre-existing. I think the
worst that can happen is a failed VMRUN because the VMSAs become invalid, no?
