I'm curious about the details of this enumeration failure.  Do you
know which TLPs had No Snoop and Relaxed Ordering set?  Per the PCIe
spec, they shouldn't be set for the config requests used for PCI core
enumeration.

At least *some* config reads to the BE200 must work; otherwise, we
wouldn't know the Vendor or Device ID, which we need to apply the
quirk.  So I think you should see something like this in dmesg, and
BE200 would probably appear in lspci output:

  pci 0000:04:00.0: [8086:272b] type 00 class ...

Is the failure that iwl_pci_probe() itself fails somehow?

You mentioned that this happens on Jetson Thor, but I'm not sure what
PCIe controller that is.  My guess is it might be Tegra264 [1], which
doesn't look like it's merged yet.

Thierry, Manikanta, do you have any insight into this?  Does this PCIe
controller set No Snoop and Relaxed Ordering for some reason?  I don't
think endpoint drivers are expecting that.
