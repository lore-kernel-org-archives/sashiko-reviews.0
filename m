It's mostly fine. Actually I dropped this patch in the next version and
kept using svm->asid for SEV (but I moved its initialization to VMCB
init). With that, handling SEV TLB flushes boils down to flushing on
nested transitions if svm->asid == svm->nested.asid02, which we need to
do anyway in case both L1 and L2 are using the fallback ASID.
