Right, I don't see any mention of PCI_EXP_DEVCTL_RELAX_EN or
PCI_EXP_DEVCTL_NOSNOOP_EN or even PCI_EXP_DEVCTL there.  And it would
have to be set in the Root Port for it to affect the MMIO read
request, not in BE200.  That would affect everything under the RP, so
I think these are probably most useful in the DMA direction where an
individual device can control its own Requests.

But the analyzer saw them set in the request from the Root Port, so
it's still a mystery why what happened.
