But this particular RMI function is called from a context where sleeping
is fine.

Yes

A 'successful' cancel returns RMI_INCOMPLETE. Or as the spec puts it:

 | The RMI_OP_CANCEL command does not have any success conditions

There's a WARN_ON_ONCE if regs->a0 is anything but RMI_INCOMPLETE in
rmi_sro_memxfer_execute(). This should never happen.

According to the spec: no.

I'll add a check (with a WARN_ON_ONCE) for buggy RMM behaviour which
errors out early.

Yes, but the RMM is considered trusted.

There are plenty of other ways of the RMM breaking the normal world. In
particular APIs like RMI_RTT_DATA_UNMAP return physical addresses which
Linux trusts are correct.

This is a "should never happen" condition (which has a WARN_ON_ONCE).

True - a corrupted list length causes further things to break. It seems
a bit much to try to handle such corruption.

The specification requires that can_cancel is true when a memory
allocation is requested.

It's also not really clear what the alternative is here - if the RMM
requests memory and doesn't allow cancellation then the only way of
finishing the operation is to provide it with the memory.

Indeed, if the operation is incomplete the code attempts to complete the
operation. The only other option would be to give up on using the RMM,
but how do we choose the maximum number of loops before giving up?

Ultimately we do have to trust the RMM to some extent to obey the spec.

I'm not sure what braindead version of Sashiko was used on this patch.
For some reason it seems to have completely forgotten standard Linux and
somewhat missed the context of how the RMM fits into the system.

Yes it unconditionally wipes the context of the struct - the struct is
provided purely to avoid having to do an extra memory allocation. This
is a helper maco for the cases where we don't provide a way of dropping
into a less restrictive state to retry the allocation.

This is admittedly a missing piece - currently there are no call sites
that do the stated dance of dropping locks to retry a memory allocation.
