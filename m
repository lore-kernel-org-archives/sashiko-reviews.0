Yes, I should have explicitly called this out. This replaces the
apparently thread-safe push/pop sequence with reusing the GPR switching
logic in SVM, which isn't thread-safe at all (uses a global array).

However this is still an improvement imo because:
- The logic here is half-baked and prompts the UCALL clobber hack as it
  doesn't properly save/restore everything. Reusing the GPR switching
  logic used by SVM allows us to drop that hack.

- It's more likely (imo) that we hit a problem due to the half-baked
  GPR save/restore logic than thread-safety. This is evidently true by
  the fact that the stress test added in this series fails on VMX with
  the existing push/pop sequence. OTOH, no tests are failing on SVM due
  to lack of thread-safety. There is only one test that uses more than
  one vCPU with nested anyway (the memstress test).

I think the logical next step is to move the GPR array to be per-vCPU,
making it thread-safe for both VMX and SVM in a proper way, but this is
outside the scope of this series.
