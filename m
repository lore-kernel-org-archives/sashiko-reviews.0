I think this needs another discussion. I agree there were differences
of opinion but thought we'd ended up with the different names rather
than attributes for each one.

Why do we need to reject writes?  The device just drops them. Maybe
it is a nice to have to prevent the mapping path setting up writeable mappings
and so fault earlier but I'm not sure it is necessary.
