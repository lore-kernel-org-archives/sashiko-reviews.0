I think that this may be a hard to hit scenario, but to be sure I think it 
should not hurt to hold the slots lock here as well.

Have to properly check if I won't cause any kind of dead/live lock here, 
though.

Yes, that's an expected tradeoff. I believed it would be fine as the 
usecase I had in mind for dirty-tracking was live migration, which usually 
tracks all memory at once, causing no performance degradation.

If we are dirty-tracking a memslot during the whole VM runtime, as is the 
case for a VGA framebuffer, maybe this is a special scenario, and we should 
make the page dirty as well.

If there is a common use case for tracking a single memory slot of regular 
memory (not used as device memory and so on), then maybe this patch has to 
be reworked to take that into account.

There is a comment on that above.

This is called when we enable dirty-tracking, and the next steps after that 
will be to clean the dirty-bits and then do a TLBi, so it should be fine 
for that scenario.

Maybe I should add a comment to explain the caller is responsible to carry 
a TLBi.

Not sure what this is trying to point. 

Yes, disabling HAFDBS will not happen if we are deleting the memslot, and 
also it will not enable it again if it's already enabled, so we should be 
safe.

Thanks!
