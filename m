Yeah I see what you're trying to get at, but I guess I just disagree.

There's also a risk thing - if you erroneously get a report for SCSI (as
you did, IIUC) then you can opt out at that point and not worry about it
again.

If we erroneously _don't_ get a report for something that didn't speak
up because they're not on the list, didn't dare say anything, didn't pay
attention, etc. then nobody ever knows until someone starts exploiting
it?

Well, you could also argue that there's one opt-out the other way around
so far (yours). You're not going to get the full set of information
required on this list either way around.

Maybe all that just means it needs to be easier to actually decide
either way. Doing it in the kernel as Greg suggested, would perhaps
lower the bar vs. some external Sashiko contribution.
