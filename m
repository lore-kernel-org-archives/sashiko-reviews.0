I might have misremembered. Let me ask for some eyes on this.

Here's my case for adding shareable and read_only as a sub-attribute:

Shareable and read-only are independent bits, and a DC region can be
both, so we have 4 possibilities: dynamic_ram, dynamic_shared, dynamic_readonly, dynamic_shared_readonly.
Every consumer of the mode string grows with it: the memdev group
names, the decoder mode store, the mode-name helper in hdm.c, the
region mode description, cxl_test, QEMU and ndctl. If a third
property comes up later (but probably not?), it would double again.

What it would look like for new modes:

enum cxl_partition_mode {
 	CXL_PARTMODE_RAM,
 	CXL_PARTMODE_PMEM,
 	CXL_PARTMODE_DYNAMIC_RAM_1,
+	CXL_PARTMODE_DYNAMIC_SHARED_1,
+	CXL_PARTMODE_DYNAMIC_READONLY_1,
+	CXL_PARTMODE_DYNAMIC_SHARED_READONLY_1,
 };
 
+static inline bool cxl_partmode_is_dc(enum cxl_partition_mode mode)
+{
+	return mode >= CXL_PARTMODE_DYNAMIC_RAM_1;
+}

static const char *cxl_mode_name(enum cxl_partition_mode mode)
 		return "pmem";
 	case CXL_PARTMODE_DYNAMIC_RAM_1:
 		return "dynamic_ram_1";
+	case CXL_PARTMODE_DYNAMIC_SHARED_1:
+		return "dynamic_shared_1";
+	case CXL_PARTMODE_DYNAMIC_READONLY_1:
+		return "dynamic_readonly_1";
+	case CXL_PARTMODE_DYNAMIC_SHARED_READONLY_1:
+		return "dynamic_shared_readonly_1";
 	default:
 		return "";

If support for partitions 2-8 is added later, this multiplies by 8.

NDCTL would also need to support 4 modes of region creation:

cxl create-region ... -t dynamic_ram_1/dynamic_shared_1/dynamic_readonly_1/dynamic_shared_readonly_1

Counter argument:
Shareable and read_only are different enough from "regular" DC that
they should be their own modes. Since PMEM isn't expressed as a adding
a "persistent" attribute under ram/, the same should apply for shareable
and read_only. Especially since pmem can't be onlined as system RAM
through the normal path, the logic should also apply to
shareable and r_o.

If we prefer separate partition modes, I can do that, but we gotta decide
now because partition setup is in the prep series.

I see. I thought it would be better to do it since the dropped write
is silent?

CXL r4.0 Section 9.13.3 "If the host issues a write to any DPA in a
read-only DC Region, the device shall drop the write and send an NDR
(see Section 3.3.9) as a response". I assume the rc is an ordinary Cmp,
which is returned for "completions for writebacks, reads and
invalidates" (Section 3.3.9 Table 3-50).

So any user that that maps the dax device writable thinks its stores
landed which seems not very good.
