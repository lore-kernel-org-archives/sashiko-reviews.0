Thanks for the review comments.
BTW, why this only to linux-perf-users? (Maybe I need to modify Sashiko setting)

Hmm, good catch!
OK, use a pair of irq_work and work to call on_each_cpu() for some
interrupt context.
For NMI context, I think wprobe_trigger should check the original state
is in_nmi(). This can work for normal trace events or fprobe, but not
for kprobes, because kprobe handler itself is working inside NMI context.
Hmm, let me check how can I fix this. Until solving this problem, this
wprobe trigger may not work with kprobes.
Also, I found the lock should protect the wprobe itself, not data.
Let me move the irq_work and lock to trace_wprobe.

Hmm, we may need to pass to original context (calculated by preempt_count)
to trigger event so that it can evaluate the original context.
(BTW, )

OK, so move the worker to wprobe because anyway the worker will update
the wprobe itself.

Indeed, let's use call_rcu().

Ah, good catch. OK, let me call synchronize_rcu() before returning.

Ah, indeed. I will use a combination of irq_worker and worker and use
on_each_cpu() with wait=true for safety.

OK, let me fix it.

OK, call trace_event_put_ref directly in wprobe_trigger_cmd_parse().

I decided to use a lock in trace_wprobe side and use READ_ONCE/WRITE_ONCE()
which may be enough.

Thank you,
