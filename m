That depends on the type of theoretical bug: for instance, if a value
is used to calculate an offset into an array, it makes sense to have
a check to avoid accessing data outside the array size. Also, if
a value is used as a denominator, it makes sense to check if the value
is not zero.

We do have such kind of checks on most media drivers - and there
ended helping to avoid OOPSes due to problematic hardware. That's
specially true on peripheral hardware like USB devices: they tend
to have a lot of such bugs, up to the point that we can't really
trust the device.

So, I'd say that, instead of a global prompt saying to trust hardware,
the best is to do it only on places where people are absolutely sure
that the hardware is trusty enough.

In practice, on most cases, it is hard to distinguish buggy from
malicious. IMO, it is better to prevent cases that could be=20
too dangerous, even if aren't there any confirmation that the
issue happened on an actual hardware.
