Yeah I think we discussed making it its own partition mode but I don't think there
was a strong consensus, just that we agreed it should be exposed somewhere,
somehow...

I am leaning towards just putting it under dynamic_ram_1 even though
these attributes would only exist for dynamic_ram mode:

/sys/bus/cxl/devices/memX/dynamic_ram_1/shareable
/sys/bus/cxl/devices/memX/dynamic_ram_1/read_only

Mainly because if we go up to 8 partitions, we would have
(dynamic_ram, dynamic_shared, dynamic_readonly, dynamic_shared_readonly) * 8.
And NDCTL would have to know how to handle creating each type.

I also don't see anything in the code that makes it terrible:
- each partition mode has its own attribute array and visibility callback
  function, so it doesn't affect ram/pmem modes

I brought it up because I wasn't sure if there was a specific reason why
shareable and read_only weren't carried over after the partition
rework. From a code standpoint, it seems fine to me?
I assumed it was so all partitions would share common sub-attributes
but I guess I shouldn't have assumed...

Mmm very true. You might just clarifying this point here but just to make
sure we're on the same page: I dropped the R_O part of the series and deferred
it for the future because it includes implementing write rejection for
r_o partitions which IMO can be done after the core functionality is in.
