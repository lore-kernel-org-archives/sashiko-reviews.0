It should only be cleaned after dirtied, which happens after dirty_log is 
enabled, which happens way after initalization.

It is the same algorithm as the generic sw cleaning. Those verifications 
already happen in the caller function.

The write is already captured, and will be reported to the user at the 
end of this syscall. If it gets dirty before the bit is actually clean, 
there is no issue, as the user already knows the page is dirty.

It will not. 
HACDBS will fail because the block level is not the same as reported.

So it falls back to software.

Interestingly enough, no code actually checks if the splitting actually 
succeeded before proceeding.

Its the other way around, split_end is used to skip splitting if the value 
is smaller than it. 

Say the block addr and size are 0x1000, it splits from 0x1000 to 
0x2000. split_end will be 0x1FFF, and any value above that (starting at 
0x2000) will trigger a new split. That's why the '-1' is at the end of its 
calculation.

Look previous patches.

This is a VHE exclusive feature, as seen in the first patch.

Yes, see previous patches.

Looks like so. But the software routine would just scan the dirty-bitmap 
and do nothing but flush the TLBs as it's needed. We can avoid this by 
adding and ret=0; after idx=0; so they will be always equal in this case.

It does exit with a positive integer, but that is not returned by generic 
code. It will only cause a goto: out, which will return 0;

VHE-only feature.

It can be put in a block, it can be declared before.
I have no issue dealing with this, but does not currently cause any build 
error.
