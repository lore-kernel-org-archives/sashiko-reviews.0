That's also my understanding. But tasks that have
CAP_SYS_RESOURCE|CAP_SYS_ADMIN should be trustworthy to not burn
system's resources.

I meant task exit, but closing the socket also makes sense because that
is when dead cyclic reference can appear. However, unless the file
descriptor's refcount reaches 0, the fs layer will not call us. We could
change fs/, but I am not sure if we should invade into fs/ just for this
one.

For the "resource is still consumed indefinitely after task exit" issue,
then scheduling GC at task exit is good enough.

If the task does not exit, those dead cyclic references can sit there
indefinitely. But this is not really critical as it is capped by
RLIMIT_NOFILE. Additionally it is impossible to prevent a "malicious"
task from creating RLIMIT_NOFILE inflight sockets and just leave them
there.

Agree. For the GC triggering thingy, it is a trade-off between CPU
consumption and how early garbage gets cleared, so that can arguably
stay. But the waiting part has to go.

Yep. Additionally gc_in_progress is not read/write under any lock, so
it is possible to read a stale gc_in_progress and the GC gets delayed
indefinitely. That is already on my todo list, among a few other
things. But let's get this most important piece done first.
