1) A controller that reports CAP.NP, but does not have a BAR size to accomodate
   that amount of ports, would already have been rejected in ahci_init_one(),
   so ahci_save_initial_config() would never even get called.

2) Having bit 31 set in the PI register, would require CAP.NP to have a value
   of at least 31 (meaning 32 ports, since it is zeroes based).

   See the register description of the PI register:
   3.1.4 Offset 0Ch: PI – Ports Implemented
   This register indicates which ports are exposed by the HBA. It is loaded by
   the BIOS. It indicates which ports that the HBA supports are available for
   software to use. For example, on an HBA that supports 6 ports as indicated
   in CAP.NP, only ports 1 and 3 could be available, with ports 0, 2, 4, and 5
   being unavailable.
   Software must not read or write to registers within unavailable ports.
   The intent of this register is to allow system vendors to build platforms
   that support less than the full number of ports implemented on the HBA
   silicon.

   Thus, AFAICT, having a bit set in the PI register that is higher than CAP.NP,
   would be violating the spec.

Yes, a device's generic IP block hardcodes CAP.NP to some value (the number
of ports theoretically supported by the hardware), and then a manufacturer
can chose to only implement certain ports (using the PI register).

If the manufacturer did not have the ability to change CAP.NP, I doubt
that they will have the ability to change the size of the BAR, which should
be determined by the device's generic IP block, and should have a size that
can accomodate CAP.NP.

While the spec says:
"Software must not read or write to registers within unavailable ports."

Not having a BAR that is not enough to accomodate CAP.NP seems very wrong.

If we ever find such a controller, I would prefer to quirk that controller
to simply override (the obviously bogus) CAP.NP.


Kind regards,
Niklas
