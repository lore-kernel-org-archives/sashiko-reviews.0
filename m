For the record, I had locally added a warning to svm_switch_vmcb() to
make sure that guest_mode and the active VMCB are consistent when
kvm_service_local_tlb_flush_requests() is called. Given that we are
going with open coding the calls, I will add a wrapper for the
warn+call:

static void nested_svm_service_local_tlb_flushes(struct vcpu *vcpu)
{
        struct vcpu_svm *svm = to_svm(vcpu);

        /*
         * TLB flushes are applied to the VMCB, so apply any pending TLB flushes
         * on the outgoing VMCB before switching to a new one. A TLB flush could
         * purge the relevant HV TLB flush FIFO depending on guest_mode, so make
         * sure the VMCB and guest_mode context is consistent.
         */
        WARN_ON_ONCE(is_guest_mode(vcpu) != (svm->vmcb == svm->nested.vmcb02.ptr));
        kvm_service_local_tlb_flush_requests(vcpu);
}
