I beg to differ.

First of all, it is not clear whether or not the power states of
non-PM devices should matter.  If so, then transitioning a device into
a new power state should cause the power states of all of its non-PM
descendants to the same power state which doesn't happen.  The
existing code doesn't do that even for the immediate children.

Next, acpi_bus_get_power_flags() skips non-PM devices, so
acpi_bus_init_power() is only called for them from acpi_bus_attach().

Indeed, passing a non-PM device to acpi_bus_init_power() causes it to
inherit the current power state of the parent, but this is just the
power state of the parent at this specific time.  The power state of
the child doesn't change after that point and if the parent is
power-manageable, its state may change.  For instance, it may be in D0
initially and then it may transition to D3cold, but the "power state"
of the child will still be D0.  This is not different from the
situation after the change.

Suppose though that the parent is initially in, say, D3hot.  It will
pass this power state to the child and if the child has power
manageable children, they will never be allowed to transition into D0
(if they were in D3hot initially).

In the absence of full power state propagation from power-manageable
devices to their non-PM descendants, leaving all of the non-PM devices
in D0 is better IMV, which is what the patch does (although admittedly
it may be good to mention that in the changelog).

Not really, and it may even help (see above).

This doesn't happen in practice though because the parent-child
dependency tracking is done at the physical devices level, not at the
ACPI device objects level.
