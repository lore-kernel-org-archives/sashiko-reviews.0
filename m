I'm not a PCIe protocol expert, but it's hard for me to see how No
Snoop would be useful for outbound transactions initiated by the Root
Port.

For inbound DMA transactions without No Snoop, the RC can enforce
cache coherency by snooping CPU caches before accessing main memory.
If a driver knows that the main memory target is uncached or doesn't
need coherency, it can set No Snoop on its device to bypass the CPU
cache snoop.

But for outbound reads or writes from the RP, the completer is the
PCIe device that claims the transaction address, and I don't think any
other device or switch is able to snoop caches and affect the
response.

I suspect there *is* potential benefit for Relaxed Ordering on
outbound transactions, but I think drivers would need to be aware of
this.  Maybe the Linux driver model already comprehends this, and we
should enable RO on RPs.  Either way, I think we should configure RO
explicitly so drivers know what to expect and the behavior doesn't
depend on whatever firmware did.

This is in PCIe r7.0, sec 7.5.3.4:

  Enable Relaxed Ordering - If this bit is Set, the Function is
  permitted to set the Relaxed Ordering bit in the Attributes field of
  transactions it initiates that do not require strong write ordering
  (see § Section 2.2.6.4 and § Section 2.4).

  A Function is permitted to hardwire this bit to 0b if it never sets
  the Relaxed Ordering attribute in transactions it initiates as a
  Requester.

  When not hardwired to 0b, the default value of this bit is 1b.


  Enable No Snoop - If this bit is Set, the Function is permitted to
  Set the No Snoop bit in the Requester Attributes of transactions it
  initiates that do not require hardware enforced cache coherency (see
  § Section 2.2.6.5). Note that setting this bit to 1b should not
  cause a Function to Set the No Snoop attribute on all transactions
  that it initiates. Even when this bit is Set, a Function is only
  permitted to Set the No Snoop attribute on a transaction when it can
  guarantee that the address of the transaction is not stored in any
  cache in the system.

  This bit is permitted to be hardwired to 0b if a Function would
  never Set the No Snoop attribute in transactions it initiates.

  Default value of this bit is 1b.
