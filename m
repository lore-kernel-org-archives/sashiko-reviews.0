We've always been a bit vague on whether the expectation is that a trigger
can be used by another device when not being used by this one.  It shouldn't
crash, but you may well not get data ;)

Rather than decrementing?

If you set it volatile, I assume the dance around marking the cache as
wrong is not needed?

Please do.  Those rules are about code fragility rather than just bugs.

True, but still nice to balance if easily done.
