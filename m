Ok, well in any case the upper bound is going to be the largest possible
block mapping for a given page granule.

Read-only translations will continue to generate permission faults
whereas writable-clean descriptors can be updated by hardware. You get
the opportunity to split a block mapping lazily while preserving
hardware dirty tracking for page mappings.

What I'm saying is the presumption that eager page splitting is always a
net-win is wrong. Nor is eager page splitting a hard requirement for
using HDBSS since you can set up the stage-2 in such a way that only
page granularity mappings are dirtied by hardware.

You could, in theory, have a workload that is read-heavy for a majority
of the VM's address space and writes to only a subset of that memory.
Eagerly splitting pages would likely regress the workload from a higher
rate of TLB refills / more TLB walk steps.

Lazily splitting would have the effect of leaving block mappings in
place for most of the VM. This is exactly why the VMM is in the driver
seat for deciding whether to lazily or eagerly split the stage-2.

The approach I think we may need is:

 - Use a software bit in the PTE to stash whether or not a PFN is
   'software-writable' when constructing the stage-2. By this I mean
   we've already faulted it in for write from the primary MMU.

 - At the time of write protection, reap the hardware-writable state
   from all PTEs but preserve the software-writable bit.

 - Whenever splitting a block mapping, set the DBM bit in the page-level
   PTEs if the block was software-writable and HDBSS is present.

That way you'd have sufficient metadata in the PTE to safely set DBM. We
could even make use of that metadata for write faults on non-HDBSS
hardware to avoid the overheads of user_mem_abort() (e.g. VMA lookup)
and treat it more like access flag updates.

The last point still needs some thought.

Thanks,
Oliver
