This specific race between ata_scsi_requeue_deferred_qc() and scsi_timeout()
has not existed for that long, because ata_scsi_requeue_deferred_qc() itself
is not that old.

Perhaps ata_scsi_requeue_deferred_qc(), instead of calling
ata_scsi_qc_done(qc, ...) directly to finish the command, should instead set
ATA_QCFLAG_RETRY (or similar) and call ata_qc_schedule_eh(qc, ...), such that
scsi_eh_scmd_add() will be called, and then EH will requeue the command instead
the completion path.

This way, there should be no race between ata_scsi_requeue_deferred_qc() ->
scsi_done() -> scsi_complete() -> scsi_queue_insert() and scsi_timeout(), as
it will be EH itself that requeues the command.


Note that while link->deferred_qc is set, we can only get a block layer timeout.
If the command was actually issued by the workqueue, link->deferred_qc will be
NULL, so the code in ata_scsi_cmd_error_handler() to handle the race between
normal completion and scsi_timeout() is not really applicable for link->deferred_qc.
(If link->deferred_qc is set, this qc cannot have raced against completion, only
against timeout.)


Kind regards,
Niklas
