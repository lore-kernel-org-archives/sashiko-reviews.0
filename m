GICv5's ITS works differently to the GICv3 ITS. The tables are in guest 
memory only, and there's no additional work required to restore them. As 
long as guest memory is correctly saved/restored and we retain the 
ITS_DT_BASER/IRS_DT_CFGR then we can recover all translations the guest 
has set up.

A guest can (well, MUST) program the table registers while the ITS is 
disabled and then enable the ITS; userspace can restore that same state 
in another order. Changes to table configuration or ITS enable state 
clear cached translations, and there is no decoded table state to 
rebuild. I've left CTRL_INIT as a no-op.

This was a bug. I've added userspace-only write handlers for IDR0–IDR2: 
they restore supported fields and return -EINVAL for unsupported 
configurations or attempts to set RES0 bits. Guest MMIO writes remain 
ignored as these are RO from the guest's point of view.

This was a mistake. The HAS path incorrectly required the ITS base to be 
set. I've removed that check from KVM_HAS_DEVICE_ATTR while retaining it 
for GET and SET, and updated the selftests and documentation accordingly.

Yeah, as above this was a mistake. I've added restore handlers for the 
ID registers and READ_EVENT_DATAR. These reject unsupported ID values 
for the ID registers. CR1 already stores its readable state. ITS_SYNCR 
has no retained state and reads as zero, so there's nothing to do here.

The guest can configure the tables while disabled and then enable the 
ITS, reaching the same final state. Any changes to the table 
configuration clear cached translations. There is no decoded table state 
to rebuild, so I've left CTRL_INIT as a no-op.

A failed registration does leave the base set, and a later address SET 
returns -EEXIST. The existing GICv3 ITS path behaves the same way. This 
follows a resource failure during ITS setup, when userspace cannot 
realistically continue running the VM as configured, so I have left this 
path unchanged.
