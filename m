Thank you Sashiko, but being able to issue commands to multiple links at
the same time is the whole point of this series.

With PMP FBS, it is allowed to mix NCQ and non-NCQ to *different drives*.

Mixing NCQ and non-NCQ commands to the *the same drive* will still not
be allowed.

So this change in behavior is very much intended.

This review comment is correct, but this was because of a mistake in
V4 which accidentally did "goto defer_qc" instead of "goto free_qc".

This is fixed in V5. In V5 PMP CBS will never make use of the deferred QC
issuing via workqueue feature, so this review command can be disregarded.


Kind regards,
Niklas
