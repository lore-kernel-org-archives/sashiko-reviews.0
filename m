I think this is the best solution, it also means you can drop the comment :)

I don't think it would go against the architecture though, because:

1. I see in [0] that FEAT_SPE_FnE (as exposed in PMSIDR_EL1.FnE) is mandatory for
   ARMv8.7+ if FEAT_SPE is implemented:

"From Armv8.7, if FEAT_SPE is implemented, the value 0 is not permitted."

2. And in [1] that FEAT_FGT is mandatory for ARMv8.6+ if EL2 is implemented:

"In an Armv8.6 implementation, if FEAT_AA64EL2 or FEAT_AA64EL3 is implemented,
FEAT_FGT is implemented."

3. And finally I see in [0] that PMSIDR_EL1.FDS relies on FEAT_SPEv1p4
   (ARMv8.9):

"FDS, bit [7]
When FEAT_SPEv1p4 is implemented:"

Or in shorthand:

1. FnE: >=v8.7
2. FGT: >=v8.6
3. FDS: >=v8.9

So either FnE or FDS already guarantees you FGT (the VHE implementation requires
EL2 anyway).

To be clear - I'd simplify everything by replacing the VM-level check here with
an explicit check on PMSIDR_EL1. I will share suggested code in the review of
the actual patch to make that more concrete!

Agreed, I think this one is a non-issue.
