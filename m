So do you get two hits on each trigger? Definitely bad as they can be in threads
running at the same time and we assume that doesn't happen in most drivers.

I'd go with "probably not the intended result" as if it were I 'think'
I'd have left a comment.

That's not to say I have an immediate answer to how to resolve it.
If you still have your test set up, can you try just carrying on and
not returning after the set_trigger_state(trig, false) fails - making
sure that your injected failure leaves the trigger actually enabled
and still firing.  That might leave us in a recoverable state as
next set_triggers_state(trig, true) should work as normal. In meantime
we will have a bunch of irqs firing but resulting in nothing happening.

Not great and may well leave some drivers stuck because they are
tightly couple trigger / data readback and need that to happen to
not get wedged.  Those should have the validate callbacks set but
will still be stuck.  In theory we could make all triggers that
have this property do a clear in the reenable but that is a bit
nasty as we would probably want it conditional so each driver would
need a 'have I already cleared this' flag set in their buffer
read and cleared in the reenable.

Thanks for digging into this btw!
