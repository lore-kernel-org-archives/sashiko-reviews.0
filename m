I vaguely recall the discussion on this ending up with we'd call the
partition something different to reflect the extra property.  

dynamic_readonly_1 / dynamic_sharedram_1 maybe?  Argument being
that these properties are as different from normal RAM as persistent
memory is.

In theory yes, in practice there isn't a path for non DCD to actually
get the data in place and transtion to read only so maybe an expensive
source of zeros?  So yes allowed but not much use to anyone so we
won't see it.
