While not _directly_ related, this does seem at odds with the
implications of R_JCXVS.

I.e. when HD is set, the PTW can speculatively fetch the S2 translation for
write before knowing if the S1 descriptor is actually subject to an
update per R_HDTRB.

It obviously all still fits together (permission checks are later down
the line), just weird is all. Anyway...

We still need to account for host-induced permission faults, e.g. dirty
tracking or an RO memslot getting mapped into the L2. So I think we
still need to evaluate R+W before forwarding to the L1.

Looking ahead to HAFDBS, for this to work we will need to use a liberal
interpretation of R_JCXVS at the time of the initial translation fault
and always walk with intent for write.

Basically, there seems to be a subtle difference arising between writes
as observed from the nested MMU and writes as observed at the virtual
endpoint (memslot). Funny how something as straightforward as the access
flag can be so headache inducing :)

All aboard :) I've just been staring at dirty state crap for too long. I
really like the unsupported atomic fault over our current behavior of
injecting an SEA.

I'll fold all of this into v3.

Thanks,
