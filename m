Understood. I verified your point against the code:
ext4_page_mkwrite() -> ext4_block_page_mkwrite() ->
ext4_block_write_begin(handle, folio, 0, len) with len =
i_size - folio_pos, and nothing zeroes [i_size, folio_size) on the
write fault path; block_page_mkwrite() behaves the same. I agree
the mmap-past-EOF semantics put the responsibility on the user.

I'll drop the mkwrite hunk in v3 and fix the commit message
accordingly (drop the inaccurate "mirrors block_page_mkwrite()"
claim, refer to the ext4 size-growth zeroing instead), keeping the
write_iter() and do_setattr() zeroing. Will post after testing.

Best regards,
Nan Lin
