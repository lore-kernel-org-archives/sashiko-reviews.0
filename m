Calling snp_page_reclaim() is only needed when the page is reclaimed before
LAUNCH_FINISH. Once the VM is running, which is is when it issues a
svm_vmgexit_ap_creation() request, then an RMPUPDATE is sufficient.

This is not an issue because the RMPUPDATE will only fail when the VMSA is
currently used by a CPU in guest-mode (== its VCPU is running).

But in the sev_es_vcpu_free_vmsa() path this can not happen because this
function is always called in the context of the affecting VCPUs thread, which
makes sure that the VCPU is not in guest-mode.
